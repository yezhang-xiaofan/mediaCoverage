Wales",Gale CP and Cattle BA and Woolston A and Baxter PD and West TH and Simms AD and Blaxill J and Greenwood DC and Fox KA and West RM,"AIMS: To examine age-dependent in-hospital mortality for hospitalization with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in England and Wales. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mixed-effects regression analysis using data from 616 011 ACS events at 255 hospitals as recorded in the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project (MINAP) 2003-2010; 102 415 (16.7%) patients were aged <55 years and 72 721 (11.9%) >/=85 years. Patients >/=85 years with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were less likely to receive emergency reperfusion therapy than those <55 years (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.25-0.28). Older patients had greater lengths of stay (P< 0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (P< 0.001). For STEMI and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), there were reductions in in-hospital mortality from 2003 to 2010 across all age groups including the very elderly. For STEMI >/= 85 years, in-hospital mortality reduced from 30.1% in 2003 to 19.4% in 2010 (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38-0.75, P< 0.001), and for NSTEMI >/= 85 years, from 31.5% in 2003 to 20.4% in 2010 (RR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.73, P< 0.001). Findings were upheld after multi-level adjustment (base = 2003): male STEMI 2010 OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.75; female STEMI 2010 OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42-0.71; male NSTEMI OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.42-0.60; female NSTEMI OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.40-0.59. CONCLUSION: For patients hospitalized with ACS in England and Wales, there have been substantial reductions in in-hospital mortality rates from 2003 to 2010 across all age groups. The temporal improvements in mortality were similar for sex and type of acute myocardial infarction. Age-dependent inequalities in the management of ACS were apparent.",Missing,European heart journal,33
