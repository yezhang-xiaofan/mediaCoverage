"","","","The researchers obviously performed 2 experiments, one genetic linkage with humans, another RCT with zebrafish, but make single conclusions based on the results from the two experiments. Since Ivs and DVs were the same, I didn't code them separately, but added second study design. In the sample, the researchers used humans and zebrafish, but press release only mentions humans. I put 2 for generalization, but -9'ed number of mentions because counting the mentions of humans and zebrafish separately and adding them up would result in the same data as above.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
