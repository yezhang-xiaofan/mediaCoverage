The activity was mapped to a cluster of cryptic, quorum-sensing-regulated modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. Enacyloxin IIa and its stereoisomer designated iso-enacyloxin IIa were identified as metabolic products of the gene cluster, which encoded an unusual hybrid modular PKS consisting of multiple proteins with sequence similarity to cis-acyltransferase (cis-AT) PKSs and a single protein with sequence similarity to trans-AT PKSs. The discovery of the potent activity of enacyloxins against drug-resistant bacteria and the gene cluster that directs their production provides an opportunity for engineered biosynthesis of innovative enacyloxin derivatives and highlights the potential of Bcc bacteria as an underexploited resource for antibiotic discovery.",Missing,Chemistry & biology,18
