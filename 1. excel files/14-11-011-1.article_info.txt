Allergy to cat has increased substantially in recent years and has been shown to be positively associated with asthma. We have recently shown that the mannose receptor (MR), a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells, recognizes various glycoallergens from diverse sources and is involved in promoting allergic responses to a major house dust mite allergen in vitro. Here we investigated the potential role of MR in allergic responses to Fel d 1, a major cat allergen. Fel d 1 binding to MR was confirmed by ELISA. Using blocking, gene silencing (siRNA) experiments, and MR knock-out (MR(-/-)) cells, we have demonstrated that MR plays a major role in internalization of Fel d 1 by human and mouse antigen-presenting cells. Intriguingly, unlike other glycoallergens, recognition of Fel d 1 by MR is mediated by the cysteine-rich domain, which correlates with the presence of sulfated carbohydrates in natural Fel d 1. WT and MR(-/-) mice were used to study the role of MR in allergic sensitization to Fel d 1 in vivo. MR(-/-) mice sensitized with cat dander extract and Fel d 1 produced significantly lower levels of total IgE, Fel d 1-specific-IgE and IgG1, the hallmarks of allergic response, compared with WT mice. Our data show for the first time that Fel d 1 is a novel ligand of the cysteine-rich domain of MR and that MR is likely to play a pivotal role in allergic sensitization to airborne allergens in vivo.",Missing,The Journal of biological chemistry,286
