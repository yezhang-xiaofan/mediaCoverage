Lifelong immunosuppression decreases the incidence of graft rejection; however, nonspecific immunosuppression results in increased susceptibly to infection and cancer. Regulatory T cells (T(regs)), which suppress the activation of the immune system and induce tolerance, are currently under evaluation for use in clinical transplantation. Ex vivo expanded polyclonal T(regs) that are introduced into transplant recipients alter the balance of T effector cells to T(regs); however, experimental data suggest that alloantigen-specific T(regs) would be more effective at preventing graft rejection. We have developed a method to enrich alloantigen-specific human T(regs) based on the coexpression of activation markers, CD69 and CD71. These T(regs) could be readily expanded in vitro and demonstrated potent antigen-specific suppression. In a humanized mouse model of alloimmune-mediated injury of human skin grafts, alloantigen-specific T(regs) resulted in a significant reduction in clinically relevant indicators of dermal tissue injury when compared with polyclonal T(regs), restoring a histology comparable to healthy skin. This method of human allospecific T(reg) selection should be scalable to the clinic. The improved in vivo efficacy of alloantigen-specific T(regs) over polyclonal T(regs) shown here suggests that generating ""customized"" T(regs) with defined anti-donor allospecificities may improve current practice in clinical immunotherapy.",Missing,Science translational medicine,3
