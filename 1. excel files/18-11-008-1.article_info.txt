Treatment Outcome",Lim SH and Vaughan AT and Ashton-Key M and Williams EL and Dixon SV and Chan HT and Beers SA and French RR and Cox KL and Davies AJ and Potter KN and Mockridge CI and Oscier DG and Johnson PW and Cragg MS and Glennie MJ,"The anti-CD20 mAb rituximab is central to the treatment of B-cell malignancies, but resistance remains a significant problem. We recently reported that resistance could be explained, in part, by internalization of rituximab (type I anti-CD20) from the surface of certain B-cell malignancies, thus limiting engagement of natural effectors and increasing mAb consumption. Internalization of rituximab was most evident in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but the extent of internalization was heterogeneous within each disease. Here, we show that the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb on target B cells promotes this process and is largely responsible for the observed heterogeneity across a range of B-cell malignancies. Internalization correlated strongly with FcgammaRIIb expression on normal and malignant B cells, and resulted in reduced macrophage phagocytosis of mAb-coated targets. Furthermore, transfection of FcgammaRIIb into FcgammaRIIb negative Ramos cells increased internalization of rituximab in a dose-dependent manner. Target-cell FcgammaRIIb promoted rituximab internalization in a cis fashion and was independent of FcgammaRIIb on neighboring cells. It became phosphorylated and internalized along with CD20:anti-CD20 complexes before lysosomal degradation. In MCL patients, high FcgammaRIIb expression predicted less durable responses after rituximab-containing regimens. Therefore, target-cell FcgammaRIIb provides a potential biomarker of response to type I anti-CD20 mAb.",Missing,Blood,118
