"","Causation","Secondary Statement of Cause","In considering the potential impact of prevention programs on the HIV decline, condom distribution and promotion efforts commencing in the early 1990s may have contributed through helping build high levels of condom use for commercial and casual sex.  ","These changes were probably aided by prevention programs utilizing both mass media and church-based, workplace-based, and other interpersonal communication activities.  ","The researchers found that other important drivers have been the influence of education programmes that have shifted people's attitudes towards having multiple concurrent sexual partners in extramarital, commercial and casual relations and that have increased the acceptability of using condoms for casual sex.
