Although it is possible to expand naturally occurring T(regs), an attractive alternative possibility, particularly suited to solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, is the stimulation of total T cell populations with defined allogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) under conditions that lead to the generation or expansion of donor-reactive, adaptive T(regs). Here we demonstrate that stimulation of mouse CD4(+) T cells by immature allogeneic dendritic cells combined with pharmacological inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE) resulted in a functional enrichment of Foxp3(+) T cells. Without further manipulation or selection, the resultant population delayed skin allograft rejection mediated by polyclonal CD4(+) effectors or donor-reactive CD8(+) T cell receptor transgenic T cells and inhibited both effector cell proliferation and T cell priming for interferon-gamma production. Notably, PDE inhibition also enhanced the enrichment of human Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells driven by allogeneic APCs. These cells inhibited T cell proliferation in a standard in vitro mixed lymphocyte assay and, moreover, attenuated the development of vasculopathy mediated by autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a functionally relevant humanized mouse transplant model. These data establish a method for the ex vivo generation of graft-reactive, functional mouse and human T(regs) that uses a clinically approved agent, making pharmacological PDE inhibition a potential strategy for T(reg)-based therapies.",Missing,Science translational medicine,3
