In this study, we investigated the role of Muc5ac, which is detected shortly before worm expulsion and is associated with the production of interleukin-13 (IL-13), in resistance to this nematode. Muc5ac-deficient mice were incapable of expelling T. muris from the intestine and harbored long-term chronic infections, despite developing strong T(H)2 responses. Muc5ac-deficient mice had elevated levels of IL-13 and, surprisingly, an increase in the T(H)1 cytokine IFN-gamma. Because T(H)1 inflammation is thought to favor chronic nematode infection, IFN-gamma was neutralized in vivo, resulting in an even stronger T(H)2-type immune response. Nevertheless, despite a more robust T(H)2 effector response, the Muc5ac-deficient mice remained highly susceptible to chronic T. muris infection. Importantly, human MUC5AC had a direct detrimental effect on nematode vitality. Moreover, the absence of Muc5ac caused a significant delay in the expulsion of two other gut-dwelling nematodes (Trichinella spiralis and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis). Thus, for the first time, we identify a single mucin, Muc5ac, as a direct and critical mediator of resistance during intestinal nematode infection.",Missing,The Journal of experimental medicine,208
