The hypothesis was tested that both beta cell failure and insulin resistance can be reversed by dietary restriction of energy intake. METHODS: Eleven people with type 2 diabetes (49.5 +/- 2.5 years, BMI 33.6 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2), nine male and two female) were studied before and after 1, 4 and 8 weeks of a 2.5 MJ (600 kcal)/day diet. Basal hepatic glucose output, hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were measured. Pancreas and liver triacylglycerol content was measured using three-point Dixon magnetic resonance imaging. An age-, sex- and weight-matched group of eight non-diabetic participants was studied. RESULTS: After 1 week of restricted energy intake, fasting plasma glucose normalised in the diabetic group (from 9.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l; p = 0.003). Insulin suppression of hepatic glucose output improved from 43 +/- 4% to 74 +/- 5% (p = 0.003 vs baseline; controls 68 +/- 5%). Hepatic triacylglycerol content fell from 12.8 +/- 2.4% in the diabetic group to 2.9 +/- 0.2% by week 8 (p = 0.003). The first-phase insulin response increased during the study period (0.19 +/- 0.02 to 0.46 +/- 0.07 nmol min(-1) m(-2); p < 0.001) and approached control values (0.62 +/- 0.15 nmol min(-1) m(-2); p = 0.42). Maximal insulin response became supranormal at 8 weeks (1.37 +/- 0.27 vs controls 1.15 +/- 0.18 nmol min(-1) m(-2)). Pancreatic triacylglycerol decreased from 8.0 +/- 1.6% to 6.2 +/- 1.1% (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Normalisation of both beta cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes was achieved by dietary energy restriction alone. This was associated with decreased pancreatic and liver triacylglycerol stores. The abnormalities underlying type 2 diabetes are reversible by reducing dietary energy intake.",Missing,Diabetologia,54
