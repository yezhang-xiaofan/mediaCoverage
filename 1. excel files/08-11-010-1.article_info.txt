To explore this process further, this study examined a particular form of cutaneous repair, skin grafting. Grafting of full thickness wild-type mouse skin onto mice that had received a green fluorescent protein-bone marrow transplant after whole body irradiation led to an abundance of bone marrow-derived epithelial cells in follicular and interfollicular epidermis that persisted for at least 5 mo. The source of the epithelial progenitors was the nonhematopoietic, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha-positive (Lin(-)/PDGFRalpha(+)) bone marrow cell population. Skin grafts release high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in vitro and in vivo, which can mobilize the Lin(-)/PDGFRalpha(+) cells from bone marrow to target the engrafted skin. These data provide unique insight into how skin grafts facilitate tissue repair and identify strategies germane to regenerative medicine for skin and, perhaps, other ectodermal defects or diseases.",Missing,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,108
