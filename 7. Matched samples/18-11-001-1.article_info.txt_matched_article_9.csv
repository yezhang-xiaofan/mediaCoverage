21141812,Evidence that ferredoxin interfaces with an internal redox shuttle in Acetyl-CoA synthase during reductive activation and catalysis.,Biochemistry,Bender G and Ragsdale SW,Missing,"Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), a subunit of the bifunctional CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex of Moorella thermoacetica requires reductive activation in order to catalyze acetyl-CoA synthesis and related partial reactions, including the CO/[1-(14)C]-acetyl-CoA exchange reaction. We show that the M. thermoacetica ferredoxin(II) (Fd-II), which harbors two [4Fe-4S] clusters and is an electron acceptor for CODH, serves as a redox activator of ACS. The level of activation depends on the oxidation states of both ACS and Fd-II, which strongly suggests that Fd-II acts as a reducing agent. By the use of controlled potential enzymology, the midpoint reduction potential for the catalytic one-electron redox-active species in the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange reaction is -511 mV, which is similar to the midpoint reduction potential that was earlier measured for other reactions involving ACS. Incubation of ACS with Fd-II and CO leads to the formation of the NiFeC species, which also supports the role of Fd-II as a reductant for ACS. In addition to being a reductant, Fd-II can accept electrons from acetylated ACS, as observed by the increased intensity of the EPR spectrum of reduced Fd-II, indicating that there is a stored electron within an ""electron shuttle"" in the acetyl-Ni(II) form of ACS. This ""shuttle"" is proposed to serve as a redox mediator during activation and at different steps of the ACS catalytic cycle.","Acetylation
