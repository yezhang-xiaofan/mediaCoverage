21617122,DRB1*15 allele is a risk factor for PR3-ANCA disease in African Americans.,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,Cao Y and Schmitz JL and Yang J and Hogan SL and Bunch D and Hu Y and Jennette CE and Berg EA and Arnett FC Jr and Jennette JC and Falk RJ and Preston GA,Missing,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) disease rarely occurs in African Americans and risk factors for the disease in this population are unknown. Here, we genotyped MHC class II alleles and found that, among African Americans, those with proteinase 3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) had 73.3-fold higher odds of having HLA-DRB1*15 alleles than community-based controls (OR 73.3; 95% CI 9.1 to 591). In addition, a disproportionate number of African American patients carried the DRB1*1501 allelic variant of Caucasian descent rather than the DRB1*1503 allelic variant of African descent. Among Caucasians, those with PR3-ANCA had 2.2-fold higher odds of carrying DRB1*1501 than controls (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.0). A validation study supported by the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium confirmed the strong association between the DRB1*15 allele and PR3-ANCA disease, among African Americans. Furthermore, we found that DRB1*1501 protein binds with high affinity to amino acid sequences of sense-PR3, purportedly an antigenic epitope, and to the amino acid sequence complementary to this epitope in vitro. Peptides of sense-PR3 and complementary-PR3 also bound to TNF-alpha-induced surface expression of DRB1*1501 on peripheral neutrophils. Taken together, these data suggest HLA-DRB1*15 alleles contribute to the pathogenesis of PR3-ANCA disease.","Adolescent
