21743132,Grape seed polyphenolic extract specifically decreases abeta*56 in the brains of Tg2576 mice.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Liu P and Kemper LJ and Wang J and Zahs KR and Ashe KH and Pasinetti GM,Missing,"Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and transgenic mouse models of AD, cause synaptotoxicity and memory impairment. Grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) inhibits Abeta oligomerization in vitro and attenuates cognitive impairment and AD-related neuropathology in the brains of transgenic mice. In the current study, GSPE was administered to Tg2576 mice for a period of five months. Treatment significantly decreased brain levels of Abeta*56, a 56-kDa Abeta oligomer previously shown to induce memory dysfunction in rodents, without changing the levels of transgenic amyloid-beta protein precursor, monomeric Abeta, or other Abeta oligomers. These results thus provide the first demonstration that a safe and affordable intervention can lower the levels of a memory-impairing Abeta oligomer in vivo and strongly suggest that GSPE should be further tested as a potential prevention and/or therapy for AD.","Amyloid beta-Peptides/*biosynthesis/genetics
