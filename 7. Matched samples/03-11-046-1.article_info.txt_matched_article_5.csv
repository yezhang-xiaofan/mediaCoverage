21251212,Intracerebral transplantation of foetal neural stem cells improves brain dysfunction induced by intracerebral haemorrhage stroke in mice.,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,Wang Z and Cui C and Li Q and Zhou S and Fu J and Wang X and Zhuge Q,Missing,"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) can lead to secondary insults and severe neurological deficits. Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) was suggested as an alternative to improve ICH-induced neurological dysfunction. The present study aimed at investigating the therapeutic role and long-term survival of foetal NSCs and potential role of foetal NSCs-produced factors in ICH. Our results demonstrated that foetal NSCs could differentiate into neural axons and dendrites and astrocytes in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrated by positive double or triple staining with Hoechst, neuronal specific nuclear protein, neurofilaments and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Intracerebral transplantation of foetal NSCs 3 days after ICH induction by intrastriatal administration of bacterial collagenase could improve the functional performance in the limb-placing test and shorten the duration of the recovery from ICH-induced neural disorders. The foetal NSCs may also produce neurotrophic and/or neuroprotective factors during culture, because the culture medium alone could partially improve functional performance. Thus, our data suggest that the foetal NSCs may be one of the therapeutic candidates for ICH.","Animals
