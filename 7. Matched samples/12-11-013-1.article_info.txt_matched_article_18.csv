21502331,Critical role for Gimap5 in the survival of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.,The Journal of experimental medicine,Chen Y and Yu M and Dai X and Zogg M and Wen R and Weiler H and Wang D,Missing,"Mice and rats lacking the guanosine nucleotide-binding protein Gimap5 exhibit peripheral T cell lymphopenia, and Gimap5 can bind to Bcl-2. We show that Gimap5-deficient mice showed progressive multilineage failure of bone marrow and hematopoiesis. Compared with wild-type counterparts, Gimap5-deficient mice contained more hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but fewer lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors. The reduction of progenitors and differentiated cells in Gimap5-deficient mice resulted in a loss of HSC quiescence. Gimap5-deficient HSCs and progenitors underwent more apoptosis and exhibited defective long-term repopulation capacity. Absence of Gimap5 disrupted interaction between Mcl-1-which is essential for HSC survival-and HSC70, enhanced Mcl-1 degradation, and compromised mitochondrial integrity in progenitor cells. Thus, Gimap5 is an important stabilizer of mouse hematopoietic progenitor cell survival.","Animals
