In the current study, we evaluated the role of cholinergic transmission through spinal beta(2)-subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the control of nociceptive thresholds. We show that mechanical and thermal nociceptive thresholds are significantly lowered in beta(2)( *)-knockout (KO) mice. Using nicotinic antagonists in these mice, we demonstrate that beta(2)( *)-nAChRs are responsible for tonic inhibitory control of mechanical thresholds at the spinal level. We further hypothesized that tonic beta(2)( *)-nAChR control of mechanical nociceptive thresholds might implicate GABAergic transmission since spinal nAChR stimulation can enhance inhibitory transmission. Indeed, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline decreased the mechanical threshold in wild-type but not beta(2)( *)-KO mice, and the agonist muscimol restored basal mechanical threshold in beta(2)( *)-KO mice. Thus, beta(2)( *)-nAChRs appeared to be necessary for GABAergic control of nociceptive information. As a consequence of this defective inhibitory control, beta(2)( *)-KO mice were also hyperresponsive to capsaicin-induced C-fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that beta(2)( *)-nAChRs are implicated in the recruitment of inhibitory control of nociception, as shown by delayed recovery from capsaicin-induced allodynia, potentiated nociceptive response to inflammation and neuropathy, and by the loss of high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)-induced analgesia in beta(2)( *)-KO mice. As high-frequency TENS induces analgesia through Abeta-fiber recruitment, these data suggest that beta(2)( *)-nAChRs may be critical for the gate control of nociceptive information by non-nociceptive sensory inputs. In conclusion, acetylcholine signaling through beta(2)( *)-nAChRs seems to be essential for setting nociceptive thresholds by controlling GABAergic inhibition in the spinal cord.","Animals
