21540864,Immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of HER2 status in breast cancers are highly concordant and complementary approaches.,British journal of cancer,Lehmann-Che J and Amira-Bouhidel F and Turpin E and Antoine M and Soliman H and Legres L and Bocquet C and Bernoud R and Flandre E and Varna M and de Roquancourt A and Plassa LF and Giacchetti S and Espie M and de Bazelaire C and Cahen-Doidy L and Bourstyn E and Janin A and de The H and Bertheau P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) are currently the most commonly used methods to assess HER2 status. PCR-based assays allow quantitative determination of HER2 amplification (Q-PCR) or overexpression (Q-RT-PCR), but are not routinely used. We evaluated the relevance of Q-RT-PCR for HER2 status determination. METHODS: We compared IHC and Q-RT-PCR in 466 breast tumours. In discordant or equivocal cases, five additional methods (IHC with two other antibodies, FISH, silver in situ hybridisation (SISH) and Q-PCR) were combined to determine HER2 status. Two cases with HER2 intra-tumour heterogeneity were further explored by allelic profiles analysis and HUMARA clonality determination after microdissection. RESULTS: We observed 97.3% concordance between Q-RT-PCR and non-equivocal IHC. Twelve out of 466 cases (3%) revealed discordances between the two methods. The power of Q-RT-PCR to predict HER2 status (defined by seven methods) was similar to that of IHC. Although rare, some discordances between techniques might be due to HER2 intra-tumour heterogeneity and we report two examples, one tumour containing two distinct clones, another tumour consisting of HER2 amplified and non-amplified subclones. CONCLUSION: Q-RT-PCR and IHC are highly concordant methods for HER2 status assessment, and Q-RT-PCR allows a highly reliable quantitative assessment and could be a useful adjunct to IHC.","Alleles
