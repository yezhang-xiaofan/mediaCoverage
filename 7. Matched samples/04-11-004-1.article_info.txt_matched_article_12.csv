21177841,Long-term efficacy of bosentan in treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in children.,The European respiratory journal,Hislop AA and Moledina S and Foster H and Schulze-Neick I and Haworth SG,Missing,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate a 5-yr experience of bosentan in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A retrospective, observational study was made of children in the UK Pulmonary Hypertension Service for Children (Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK) who were given bosentan as monotherapy or in combination, from February 2002 to May 2008 and followed up for >/= 6 months. Detailed studies were made of 101 children with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) (n = 42) and PAH associated with congenital heart disease (n = 59). Before treatment, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), height, weight and haemodynamic data were determined. Evaluations were analysed after 6 months and annually to a maximum of 5 yrs. Median duration of treatment was 31.5 months. Initial improvement in WHO functional class and 6MWD was maintained for up to 3 yrs. Height and weight increased but the z-scores did not improve. After 3 yrs, bosentan was continued as monotherapy in only 21% of children with IPAH, but in 69% of repaired cases and 56% of those with Eisenmenger syndrome. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for the 101 patients were 96, 89, 83 and 60% at 1, 2, 3 and 5 yrs, respectively. A treatment regime that includes bosentan is safe and appears to be effective in slowing disease progression in children with PAH.","Adolescent
