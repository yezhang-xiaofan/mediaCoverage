21257750,Manipulations in the peripheral stalk of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae F1F0-ATP synthase.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Welch AK and Bostwick CJ and Cain BD,Missing,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase peripheral stalk is composed of the OSCP, h, d, and b subunits. The b subunit has two membrane-spanning domains and a large hydrophilic domain that extends along one side of the enzyme to the top of F(1). In contrast, the Escherichia coli peripheral stalk has two identical b subunits, and subunits with substantially altered lengths can be incorporated into a functional F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase. The differences in subunit structure between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic peripheral stalks raised a question about whether the two stalks have similar physical and functional properties. In the present work, the length of the S. cerevisiae b subunit has been manipulated to determine whether the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase exhibited the same tolerances as in the bacterial enzyme. Plasmid shuffling was used for ectopic expression of altered b subunits in a strain carrying a chromosomal disruption of the ATP4 gene. Wild type growth phenotypes were observed for insertions of up to 11 and a deletion of four amino acids on a nonfermentable carbon source. In mitochondria-enriched fractions, abundant ATP hydrolysis activity was seen for the insertion mutants. ATPase activity was largely oligomycin-insensitive in these mitochondrial fractions. In addition, very poor complementation was seen in a mutant with an insertion of 14 amino acids. Lengthier deletions yielded a defective enzyme. The results suggest that although the eukaryotic peripheral stalk is near its minimum length, the b subunit can be extended a considerable distance.","Amino Acid Sequence
