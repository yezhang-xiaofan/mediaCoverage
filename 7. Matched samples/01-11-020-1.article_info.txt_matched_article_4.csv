Multiple complex coronary lesions relate to multifocal destabilization of coronary plaques. We investigated whether bone loss could be associated with the presence of multiple complex coronary lesions. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 150 patients with recent myocardial infarction (<1 month). Multiple complex coronary lesions were determined at coronary angiography. A panoramic dental X-ray including bone loss >50% was performed. Patients with no or simple complex lesions were compared to patients with multiple complex lesions. RESULTS: Over 20% of patients had multiple complex coronary lesions. Patients with multiple complex lesion were less likely to be women and more likely to have multivessel disease or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) than patients with no or single complex lesion. Bone loss >50% tended to be more frequent in patients with multiple complex lesions (p = 0.063). In multivariate analysis, multivessel disease, gender and CRP were associated with multiple complex lesion. Bone loss >50% increased the risk of multiple complex lesion. CONCLUSION: Bone loss was associated with complex multiple coronary lesions, beyond systemic inflammation. These findings may bear important clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.","Aged
