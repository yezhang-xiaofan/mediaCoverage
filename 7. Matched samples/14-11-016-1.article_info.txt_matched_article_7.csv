21252226,Induction of glutathione peroxidase 4 expression during enterocytic cell differentiation.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Speckmann B and Bidmon HJ and Pinto A and Anlauf M and Sies H and Steinbrenner H,Missing,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an abundant selenoenzyme, is ubiquitously expressed in a tissue-, cell- and differentiation-dependent manner, and it is localized in cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear cellular compartments. Here, we report cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of GPx4 in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Enterocytic differentiation of Caco-2 cells triggers an increase in GPx4 mRNA and protein levels, mediated by enhanced promoter activity. We identified a combined cAMP response element (CREB) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site as critical for the differentiation-triggered GPx4 promoter activity. Induction of GPx4 correlated with C/EBPalpha transcript levels during differentiation, suggesting a role of C/EBPalpha as regulator of enterocytic GPx4 expression. Consistent with the in vitro results, GPx4 protein was detected in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of enterocytes in human intestinal epithelia. GPx4 is uniformly expressed in colonic crypts and is differentially expressed along the crypt-to-villus axis in the small intestine with a more pronounced expression of GPx4 in the upper villi, which contain fully differentiated enterocytes. These data suggest that intestinal GPx4 expression is modulated by the enterocytic differentiation program, and the results support a direct role of nuclear GPx4 in the (selenium-dependent) prevention of oxidative damage in the gastrointestinal tract.","CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/metabolism
