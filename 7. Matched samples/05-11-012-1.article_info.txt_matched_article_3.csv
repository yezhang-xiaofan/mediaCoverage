21447599,Striatal neurons expressing full-length mutant huntingtin exhibit decreased N-cadherin and altered neuritogenesis.,Human molecular genetics,Reis SA and Thompson MN and Lee JM and Fossale E and Kim HH and Liao JK and Moskowitz MA and Shaw SY and Dong L and Haggarty SJ and MacDonald ME and Seong IS,Missing,"The expanded CAG repeat that causes striatal cell vulnerability in Huntington's disease (HD) encodes a polyglutamine tract in full-length huntingtin that is correlated with cellular [ATP] and [ATP/ADP]. Since striatal neurons are vulnerable to energy deficit, we have investigated, in Hdh CAG knock-in mice and striatal cells, the hypothesis that decreased energetics may affect neuronal (N)-cadherin, a candidate energy-sensitive adhesion protein that may contribute to HD striatal cell sensitivity. In vivo, N-cadherin was sensitive to ischemia and to the effects of full-length mutant huntingtin, progressively decreasing in Hdh(Q111) striatum with age. In cultured striatal cells, N-cadherin was decreased by ATP depletion and STHdh(Q111) striatal cells exhibited dramatically decreased N-cadherin, due to decreased Cdh2 mRNA and enhanced N-cadherin turnover, which was partially normalized by adenine supplementation to increase [ATP] and [ATP/ADP]. Consistent with decreased N-cadherin function, STHdh(Q111) striatal cells displayed profound deficits in calcium-dependent N-cadherin-mediated cell clustering and cell-substratum adhesion, and primary Hdh(Q111) striatal neuronal cells exhibited decreased N-cadherin and an abundance of immature neurites, featuring diffuse, rather than clustered, staining for N-cadherin and synaptic vesicle markers, which was partially rescued by adenine treatment. Thus, mutant full-length huntingtin, via energetic deficit, contributes to decreased N-cadherin levels in striatal neurons, with detrimental effects on neurite maturation, strongly suggesting that N-cadherin-mediated signaling merits investigation early in the HD pathogenic disease process.","Adenine
