Directional auxin flow within tissues depends on polar localization of PIN auxin transporters. To explore regulation of PIN-mediated auxin transport, we screened for suppressors of PIN1 overexpression (supo) and identified an inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase mutant (supo1), with elevated inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) and cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Pharmacological and genetic increases in InsP(3) or Ca(2+) levels also suppressed the PIN1 gain-of-function phenotypes and caused defects in basal PIN localization, auxin transport and auxin-mediated development. In contrast, the reductions in InsP(3) levels and Ca(2+) signaling antagonized the effects of the supo1 mutation and disrupted preferentially apical PIN localization. InsP(3) and Ca(2+) are evolutionarily conserved second messengers involved in various cellular functions, particularly stress responses. Our findings implicate them as modifiers of cell polarity and polar auxin transport, and highlight a potential integration point through which Ca(2+) signaling-related stimuli could influence auxin-mediated development.","Arabidopsis/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism
