Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are crucial for intracellular oxygen sensing and organism survival. However, it remains to be clarified whether or how PHDs are involved in the regulation of beta(2) -adrenoceptor (beta(2) -AR) signalling. Here we show that PHD2 can modulate the rate of beta(2) -AR internalization through interactions with beta-arrestin 2. PHD2 hydroxylates beta-arrestin 2 at the proline (Pro)(176), Pro(179) and Pro(181) sites, which retards the recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane and inhibits subsequent co-internalization with beta(2) -AR into the cytosol. beta(2) -AR internalization is critical to control the temporal and spatial aspects of beta(2) -AR signalling. Identifying novel regulators of beta(2) -AR internalization will enable us to develop new strategies to manipulate receptor signalling and provide potential targets for drug development in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with beta(2) -AR signalling dysregulation.","Arrestins/*metabolism
