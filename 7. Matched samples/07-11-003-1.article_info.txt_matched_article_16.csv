21148072,MDC1 cleavage by caspase-3: a novel mechanism for inactivating the DNA damage response during apoptosis.,Cancer research,Solier S and Pommier Y,Missing,"Recently, we identified the ""apoptotic ring,"" containing phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX), as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis. Because gamma-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response (DDR), we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints. We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), which normally binds to gamma-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR, is cleaved by caspase-3. This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells. Also, we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL. Together, these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response.","Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics
