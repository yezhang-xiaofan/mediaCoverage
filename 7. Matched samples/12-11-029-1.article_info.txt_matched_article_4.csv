Additional pharmacogenomic and epigenetic factors are also involved. In children, pharmacogenetic studies are limited, although it has been clear for many years that the interactions between developmental patterns of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters have a major impact on dose exposure with age-specific dosage requirements. This article will analyze the factors affecting variability in drug response in children and focus on the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms of immunosuppressants, antidepressants, anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Additional pharmacogenetic and epigenetic studies should be performed to allow the individualization of therapy in children.","Animals
