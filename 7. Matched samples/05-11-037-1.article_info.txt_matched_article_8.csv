22095827,Niacin inhibits vascular inflammation via the induction of heme oxygenase-1.,Circulation,Wu BJ and Chen K and Barter PJ and Rye KA,hri,"BACKGROUND: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a cytoprotective protein whose expression is consistently associated with therapeutic benefits in a number of pathological conditions such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and inflammation. Niacin is a pleiotropic drug that slows the progression of coronary artery disease and increases serum levels of the HO-1 enzymatic product bilirubin. This study asks if the cardioprotective properties of niacin involve the induction of HO-1. METHODS AND RESULTS: New Zealand White rabbits received chow or chow supplemented with 0.6% (wt/wt) niacin for 2 weeks. Acute vascular inflammation was induced in the animals by placing a nonocclusive silastic collar around the left common carotid artery. At 24 hours after collar implantation, serum bilirubin and vascular, liver, and spleen HO-1 messenger RNA levels were significantly increased. Vascular inflammation was decreased in the niacin-supplemented animals compared with control. Treatment of the animals with tin protoporphyrin-IX, a global HO inhibitor, or HO-1 small interfering RNA to knock down carotid artery HO-1 attenuated the ability of niacin to inhibit vascular inflammation. Treatment of cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells with niacin increased HO-1 expression by activating the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced endothelial inflammation. The antiinflammatory effects of niacin in human coronary artery endothelial cells were mimicked by bilirubin and abolished by incubation with tin protoporphyrin-IX and knock down of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2. CONCLUSIONS: Niacin activates HO-1 in vivo and in vitro. Induction of HO-1 may be partly responsible for the vascular protective properties of niacin.","Animals
