21850501,Left ventricular diastolic dyssynchrony assessed with phase analysis of gated myocardial perfusion SPECT: a comparison with tissue Doppler imaging.,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,Boogers MJ and Chen J and Veltman CE and van Bommel RJ and Mooyaart EA and Al Younis I and van der Hiel B and Dibbets-Schneider P and van der Wall EE and Schalij MJ and Garcia EV and Bax JJ and Delgado V,Missing,"PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility of phase analysis on gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (GMPS) for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dyssynchrony in a head-to-head comparison with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). METHODS: The population consisted of patients with end-stage heart failure of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV with a reduced LV ejection fraction of </= 35%. LV diastolic dyssynchrony was calculated using TDI as the maximal time delay between early peak diastolic velocities of two opposing left ventricle walls (diastolic mechanical delay). Significant LV diastolic dyssynchrony was defined as a diastolic mechanical delay of >55 ms on TDI. Furthermore, phase analysis on GMPS was performed to evaluate LV diastolic dyssynchrony; diastolic phase standard deviation (SD) and histogram bandwidth (HBW) were used as markers of LV diastolic dyssynchrony. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (114 men, mean age 66.0 +/- 10.4 years) with end-stage heart failure were enrolled. Both diastolic phase SD (r = 0.81, p < 0.01) and diastolic HBW (r = 0.75, p < 0.01) showed good correlations with LV diastolic dyssynchrony on TDI. Additionally, patients with LV diastolic dyssynchrony on TDI (>55 ms) showed significantly larger diastolic phase SD (68.1 +/- 13.4 degrees vs. 40.7 +/- 14.0 degrees , p < 0.01) and diastolic HBW (230.6 +/- 54.3 degrees vs. 129.0 +/- 55.6 degrees , p < 0.01) as compared to patients without LV diastolic dyssynchrony on TDI (</= 55 ms). Finally, phase analysis on GMPS showed a good intra- and interobserver reproducibility for the determination of diastolic phase SD (ICC 0.97 and 0.88) and diastolic HBW (ICC 0.98 and 0.93). CONCLUSION: Phase analysis on GMPS showed good correlations with TDI for the assessment of LV diastolic dyssynchrony.","Aged
