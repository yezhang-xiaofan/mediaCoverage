22070284,"Deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, and enniatins: the major mycotoxins found in cereal-based products on the Czech market.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Malachova A and Dzuman Z and Veprikova Z and Vaclavikova M and Zachariasova M and Hajslova J,Missing,"Fusarium toxins, Alternaria toxins, and ergot alkaloids represent common groups of mycotoxins that can be found in cereals grown under temperate climatic conditions. Because most of them are chemically and thermally stable, these toxic fungal secondary metabolites might be transferred from grains into the final products. To get information on the commensurate contamination of various cereal-based products collected from the Czech retail market in 2010, the occurrence of ""traditional"" mycotoxins such as groups of A and B trichothecenes and zearalenone, less routinely determined Alternaria toxins (alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether and altenuene), ergot alkaloids (ergosine, ergocryptine, ergocristine, and ergocornine) and ""emerging"" mycotoxins (enniatins A, A1, B, and B1 and beauvericin) were monitored. In a total 116 samples derived from white flour and mixed flour, breakfast cereals, snacks, and flour, only trichothecenes A and B and enniatins were found. Deoxynivalenol was detected in 75% of samples with concentrations ranging from 13 to 594 mug/kg, but its masked form, deoxynivalenol-3-beta-d-glucoside, has an even higher incidence of 80% of samples, and concentrations ranging between 5 and 72 mug/kg were detected. Nivalenol was found only in three samples at levels of 30 mug/kg. For enniatins, all of the samples investigated were contaminated with at least one of four target enniatins. Enniatin A was detected in 97% of samples (concentration range of 20-2532 mug/kg) followed by enniatin B with an incidence in 91% of the samples (concentration range of 13-941 mug/kg) and enniatin B1 with an incidence of 80% in the samples tested (concentration range of 8-785 mug/kg). Enniatin A1 was found only in 44% of samples at levels ranging between 8 and 851 mug/kg.","Cereals/*chemistry
