We explored the effects of KIT inhibition using imatinib mesylate in this molecular subset of disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial at 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States of 295 patients with melanoma screened for the presence of KIT mutations and amplification between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010. A total of 51 cases with such alterations were identified and 28 of these patients were treated who had advanced unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites. INTERVENTION: Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic response, with secondary end points including time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response. RESULTS: Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-30%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6-18 weeks; 95% CI, 11-18 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P = .05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470470.","Administration, Oral
