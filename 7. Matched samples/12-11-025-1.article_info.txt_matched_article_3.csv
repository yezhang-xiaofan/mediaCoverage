22057126,Structural basis of p38alpha regulation by hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase.,Nature chemical biology,Francis DM and Rozycki B and Koveal D and Hummer G and Page R and Peti W,Missing,"MAP kinases regulate essential cellular events, including cell growth, differentiation and inflammation. The solution structure of a complete MAPK-MAPK-regulatory protein complex, p38alpha-HePTP, was determined, enabling a comprehensive investigation of the molecular basis of specificity and fidelity in MAPK regulation. Structure determination was achieved by combining NMR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering data with a new ensemble calculation-refinement procedure. We identified 25 residues outside of the HePTP kinase interaction motif necessary for p38alpha recognition. The complex adopts an extended conformation in solution and rarely samples the conformation necessary for kinase deactivation. Complex formation also does not affect the N-terminal lobe, the activation loop of p38alpha or the catalytic domain of HePTP. Together, these results show how the downstream tyrosine phosphatase HePTP regulates p38alpha and provide for fundamentally new insights into MAPK regulation and specificity.","Amino Acid Sequence
