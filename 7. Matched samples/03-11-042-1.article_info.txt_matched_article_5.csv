METHODOLOGY: Eighty-nine women with T2DM and 73 healthy controls were enrolled and divided into three age groups [group 1 (20-29 yr), seven diabetics and 18 healthy controls; group 2 (30-39 yr): 35 diabetics and 35 healthy controls; and group 3 (40-49 yr): 47 diabetics and 20 healthy controls]. All participants were subjected to transvaginal ultrasonographic examination on the third day of their menstrual periods for the determination of ovarian volume and total antral follicle count (AFC). RESULTS: A significant difference in mean FSH levels (international units per liter) was observed between women with diabetes and healthy controls in all age groups (group 1, 7.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.0; group 2, 8.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.8; group 3, 9.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 6.4 +/- 2.4; P < 0.001 for all). Similarly, mean AFC was significantly lower in patients with T2DM than in healthy controls in all age groups (group 1, 21.1 +/- 4.8 vs. 25.0 +/- 9.1; group 2, 10.4 +/- 5.2 vs. 23.0 +/- 9.5; group 3, 6.0 +/- 3.5 vs. 21.7 +/- 2.1; P < 0.001 for all). A statistically significant difference in total ovarian volume was only observed in group 1 (9.7 +/- 3.0 in T2DM patients vs. 6.8 +/- 2.7 in healthy controls; P = 0.002). AFC was found to be negatively correlated with FSH (r = -0.406, P < 0.001), age (r = -0.618, P < 0.001), glycolized hemoglobin (r = -0.505, P < 0.001), and fasting blood glucose (r = -0.687, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this pioneer study, the first to evaluate ovarian reserve in T2DM patients, we managed to demonstrate lower ovarian reserves in women with diabetes compared with healthy controls.","Adult
