22197931,Exome sequencing identifies recurrent somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations in melanoma.,Nature genetics,Nikolaev SI and Rimoldi D and Iseli C and Valsesia A and Robyr D and Gehrig C and Harshman K and Guipponi M and Bukach O and Zoete V and Michielin O and Muehlethaler K and Speiser D and Beckmann JS and Xenarios I and Halazonetis TD and Jongeneel CV and Stevenson BJ and Antonarakis SE,Missing,"We performed exome sequencing to detect somatic mutations in protein-coding regions in seven melanoma cell lines and donor-matched germline cells. All melanoma samples had high numbers of somatic mutations, which showed the hallmark of UV-induced DNA repair. Such a hallmark was absent in tumor sample-specific mutations in two metastases derived from the same individual. Two melanomas with non-canonical BRAF mutations harbored gain-of-function MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) mutations, resulting in constitutive ERK phosphorylation and higher resistance to MEK inhibitors. Screening a larger cohort of individuals with melanoma revealed the presence of recurring somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations, which occurred at an overall frequency of 8%. Furthermore, missense and nonsense somatic mutations were frequently found in three candidate melanoma genes, FAT4, LRP1B and DSC1.","Base Sequence
