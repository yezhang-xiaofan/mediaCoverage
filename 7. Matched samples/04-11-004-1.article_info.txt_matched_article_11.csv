21148227,Transforming growth factor-{beta} gene polymorphisms in different phenotypes of sarcoidosis.,The European respiratory journal,Pabst S and Franken T and Schonau J and Stier S and Nickenig G and Meyer R and Skowasch D and Grohe C,Missing,"The aetiology of sarcoidosis is unclear. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 and -beta3 have been reported to be associated with the development of lung fibrosis in patients with sarcoidosis. SNPs in TGF-beta2 (rs1891467) and TGF-beta3 (rs3917200) were investigated in 296 patients with sarcoidosis (acute/self remitting, n = 70 (including 62 patients with Lofgren's syndrome); chronic, n = 168; acute/chronic, n = 58) by real-time PCR. 32 patients showed radiological signs of lung fibrosis. The genotype frequencies were compared among the sarcoidosis groups as well as to 377 healthy controls. We found a significant association with the G-allele in rs1891467 in TGF-beta2 and an acute/self remitting course of sarcoidosis compared to a chronic course (p = 0.001). The results were even more evident for patients with Lofgren's syndrome (p<0.001). Moreover, we could demonstrate a borderline significance between TGF-beta3 (rs3917200) and lung fibrosis (p = 0.050). Carriers of the G-allele in rs1891467 might be protected from developing a chronic course. Moreover, there is evidence that rs3917200 is involved in the development of lung fibrosis in sarcoidosis. This study is the first in sarcoidosis patients to suggest a genetic implication of TGF-beta2 as a protective factor in the course of sarcoidosis.","Adult
