21335433,Divide and conquer: the application of organelle proteomics to heart failure.,Circulation research,Agnetti G and Husberg C and Van Eyk JE,Missing,"Chronic heart failure is a worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity and is the final outcome of a number of different etiologies. This reflects both the complexity of the disease and our incomplete understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. One experimental approach to address this is to study subcellular organelles and how their functions are activated and synchronized under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we discuss the application of proteomic technologies to organelles and how this has deepened our perception of the cellular proteome and its alterations with heart failure. The use of proteomics to monitor protein quantity and posttranslational modifications has revealed a highly intricate and sophisticated level of protein regulation. Posttranslational modifications have the potential to regulate organelle function and interplay most likely by targeting both structural and signaling proteins throughout the cell, ultimately coordinating their responses. The potentials and limitations of existing proteomic technologies are also discussed emphasizing that the development of novel methods will enhance our ability to further investigate organelles and decode intracellular communication.","Animals
