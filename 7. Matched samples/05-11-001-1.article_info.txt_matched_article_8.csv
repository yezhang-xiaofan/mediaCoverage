21224060,CC chemokine receptor 4 contributes to innate NK and chronic stage T helper cell recall responses during Mycobacterium bovis infection.,The American journal of pathology,Stolberg VR and Chiu BC and Schmidt BM and Kunkel SL and Sandor M and Chensue SW,Missing,"Cysteine-cysteinyl chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is expressed by a variety of T-cell subsets and leukocytes. This study examined the participation of CCR4 in response to pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium bovis Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Constitutive and induced CCR4 agonist expression was detected among large mononuclear cells. The course of infection and mobilization of effector cell populations were then analyzed in CCR4 knockout (CCR4(-/-)) mice. Compared with controls, CCR4(-/-) mice displayed delayed innate stage (<2 weeks) bacterial clearance and reduced late stage inflammation. Innate impairment was associated with reduced natural killer cell activation. In the adaptive phase, CCR4(-/-) mice generated effector T cells in draining lymph nodes and accumulated effector T cells in lungs, which resulted in normal adaptive stage bacterial elimination at 2 to 4 weeks. However, during the late stage, CCR4(-/-) mice had reduced interferongamma+CD4(+)alpha/beta+ (Th1) and interleukin (IL)-17+CD4(+)alpha/beta+ (Th17) T helper cells in lungs. In contrast, IL-17+ gamma/delta T cells in lungs were unaffected. When challenged with mycobacterial antigen- (Ag-) Ag-coated beads to elicit a recall granulomatous response, CCR4(-/-) mice displayed abrogated recall granuloma formation and reduced interferon gamma+ Th1 cells. These findings indicate that CCR4 supports innate natural killer cell activation and sustains later CD4(+) Th effector/memory antimycobacterial responses in the lung but is redundant in the early adaptive elimination phase.","Animals
