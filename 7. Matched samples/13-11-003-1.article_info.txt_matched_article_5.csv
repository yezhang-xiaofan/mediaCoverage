21183027,Anaphylatoxin C5a-induced toll-like receptor 4 signaling in bovine neutrophils.,Journal of dairy science,Stevens MG and Van Poucke M and Peelman LJ and Rainard P and De Spiegeleer B and Rogiers C and Van de Walle GR and Duchateau L and Burvenich C,Missing,"It is well known that signaling in neutrophils through both the complement component 5a (C5a) and C5a receptor (C5aR) and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways plays an essential role in innate defense. Neutrophil dysfunction, as seen during sepsis in severe mastitis during the periparturient period, is correlated with elevated concentrations of anaphylatoxin C5a. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of C5a on TLR4 signaling in bovine neutrophils. Neutrophils were incubated with a high (but physiological) dose of purified C5a, and mRNA was extracted from neutrophils at different time points postincubation (PI). The incubation with C5a resulted in a biphasic C5aR expression profile, a phenomenon that might be explained by internalization (at 10 min PI) with subsequent reconstitution (starting at 40 min PI) of this receptor. The expression of TLR4, as well as its coreceptor, CD14, showed a similar biphasic change as observed with C5aR. In addition, changes in the mRNA expression levels of several genes belonging to the TLR4 pathway, such as TICAM-1, IKKalpha, and MAP3K7 were noted. The maximal expression of TLR4, CD14, and C5aR mRNA at 80 min PI was accompanied by a peak in IL8 mRNA, indicating that C5a is able to induce IL-8 production in neutrophils in vitro without the need of a costimulatory factor such as lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, a relatively constant expression of RELA was accompanied by increased expression of ATF3, an endogenous inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB mediated transcription, implying that C5a regulates TLR4 signaling and IL-8 synthesis independently. A significant time-dependent correlation was found between C5aR and TLR4, with the majority of the selected TLR4-dependent genes showing a significant correlation with C5aR at 80 min PI, when C5aR and TLR4 mRNA expression reached its maximum, suggesting crosstalk between both receptors. Taken together, this study showed that C5a is able to (1) alter the expression of genes belonging to the TLR4 pathway and (2) induce IL8 gene expression in bovine neutrophils. In addition, indications for cross-talk between complement activation and TLR4 signaling were found in the present study.","Animals
