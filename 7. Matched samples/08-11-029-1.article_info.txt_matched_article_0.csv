22080607,Dendritic SNAREs add a new twist to the old neuron theory.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Ovsepian SV and Dolly JO,Missing,Dendritic exocytosis underpins a broad range of integrative and homeostatic synaptic functions. Emerging data highlight the essential role of SNAREs in trafficking and fusion of secretory organelles with release of peptides and neurotransmitters from dendrites. This Perspective analyzes recent evidence inferring axo-dendritic polarization of vesicular release machinery and pinpoints progress made with existing challenges in this rapidly progressing field of dendritic research. Interpreting the relation of new molecular data to physiological results on secretion from dendrites would greatly advance our understanding of this facet of neuronal mechanisms.,"Calcium/metabolism
