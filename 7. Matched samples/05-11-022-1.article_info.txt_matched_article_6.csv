21768104,Sponge transgenic mouse model reveals important roles for the microRNA-183 (miR-183)/96/182 cluster in postmitotic photoreceptors of the retina.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Zhu Q and Sun W and Okano K and Chen Y and Zhang N and Maeda T and Palczewski K,Missing,"MicroRNA-183 (miR-183), miR-96, and miR-182 comprising the miR-183/96/182 cluster are highly expressed in photoreceptor cells. Although in vitro data have indicated an important role for this cluster in the retina, details of its in vivo biological activity are still unknown. To observe the impact of the miR-183/96/182 cluster on retinal maintenance and light adaptation, we generated a sponge transgenic mouse model that disrupted the activities of the three-component microRNAs simultaneously and selectively in the retina. Although our morphological and functional studies showed no differences between transgenic and wild type mice under normal laboratory lighting conditions, sponge transgenic mice displayed severe retinal degeneration after 30 min of exposure to 10,000 lux light. Histological studies showed that the outer nuclear layer thickness was dramatically reduced in the superior retina of transgenic mice. Real time PCR experiments in both the sponge transgenic mouse model and different microRNA stable cell lines identified Arrdc3, Neurod4, and caspase-2 (Casp2) as probable downstream targets of this cluster, a result also supported by luciferase assay and immunoblotting analyses. Further studies indicated that expression of both the cluster and Casp2 increased in response to light exposure. Importantly, Casp2 expression was enhanced in transgenic mice, and inhibition of Casp2 partially rescued their light-induced retinal degeneration. By connecting the microRNA and apoptotic pathways, these findings imply an important role for the miR-183/96/182 cluster in acute light-induced retinal degeneration of mice. This study demonstrates a clear involvement of miRs in the physiology of postmitotic cells in vivo.","Animals
