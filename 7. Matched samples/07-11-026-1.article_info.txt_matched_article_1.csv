21654549,Differential regulation of protein synthesis and mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle and visceral tissues of neonatal pigs after a meal.,Pediatric research,Gazzaneo MC and Orellana RA and Suryawan A and Tuckow AP and Kimball SR and Wilson FA and Nguyen HV and Torrazza RM and Fiorotto ML and Davis TA,Missing,"Protein synthesis (PS) increases after a meal in neonates, but the time course of the changes in PS in different tissues after a meal is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the changes in tissue PS, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, and proportion of ribosomal protein (rp) mRNAs in polysomes over 4 h after a bolus meal in neonatal pigs (n = 6/group; 5- to 7-d-old). The results show a more sustained increase in PS in glycolytic compared with mixed fiber type muscles and no changes in oxidative muscles. PS increased in liver, jejunum, and pancreas but not in kidney and heart. Feeding did not affect AMP-activated protein kinase or RAS-related GTP binding B activation. Phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2, proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kD, mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein, and rp S6 kinase 1 increased in all tissues after feeding. The proportion of mRNAs encoding rp S4 and S8 in liver polysomes increased within 30 min postfeeding. These results suggest that feeding stimulates mTORC1 signaling in muscle and viscera, but mTORC1 activation alone is not sufficient to stimulate PS in all tissues.","Animals
