21435365,"Feasibility of measuring gastric emptying time, with a wireless motility device, after subjects consume fiber-matched liquid and solid breakfasts.",Appetite,Willis HJ and Thomas W and Willis DJ and Slavin JL,Missing,"To explore the feasibility and sensitivity of a new technology for measuring gastric emptying time (GET) in appetite research, and also to compare appetite after subjects consumed macronutrient- and fiber-matched liquid and solid meals. Fourteen women (BMI of 21.2 +/- 0.3) participated in this randomized, crossover study. On two separate days, fasted subjects consumed liquid (fruit juices and skim milk) and solid (oatmeal, blueberries, and apples) breakfasts. Both meals had 10 g of fiber and 410 kcal. GET was assessed with the SmartPill GI Motility System(R), appetite was assessed with visual analog scales, and food intake was measured at lunch. Despite the same amount of fiber, GET was about 1h longer after the oatmeal than after the liquids. Subjects were less hungry after the oatmeal than after the liquids. Satisfaction and fullness were marginally improved with the oatmeal compared to the liquids. There was a negative association between GET and hunger. Lunchtime food and beverage intake did not differ between treatments. The SmartPill appears feasible and sensitive in appetite research, but has limitations. A solid meal with naturally occurring fiber from oatmeal and whole fruits increased GET and decreased hunger more than a liquid meal with added fiber.","Adolescent
