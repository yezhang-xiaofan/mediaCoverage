We aimed to describe glucose turnover in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, according to stage of gestation (early vs late gestation). METHODS: The rates of systemic glucose appearance (R(a)) and glucose disposal (R(d)) were measured in ten pregnant women with type 1 diabetes during early (12-16 weeks) and late (28-32 weeks) gestation. Women ate standardised meals--a starch-rich 80 g carbohydrate dinner and a sugar-rich 60 g carbohydrate breakfast--and fasted between meals and overnight. Stable-label isotope tracers ([6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose and [U-(13)C]glucose) were used to determine R(a), R(d) and glucose bioavailability. Closed-loop insulin delivery maintained stable glycaemic conditions. RESULTS: There were no changes in fasting R(a) (10 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 2 mumol kg(-1) min(-1); p = 0.32) or fasting R(d) (11 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 1 mumol kg(-1) min(-1); p = 0.77) in early vs late gestation. There was increased hepatic insulin resistance (381 +/- 237 vs 540 +/- 242 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) x pmol/l; p = 0.04) and decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity (0.09 +/- 0.04 vs 0.05 +/- 0.02 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) per pmol/l dinner, 0.11 +/- 0.05 vs 0.07 +/- 0.03 mumol kg(-1) min(-1) per pmol/l breakfast; p = 0.002) in late gestation. It also took longer for insulin levels to reach maximal concentrations (49 [37-55] vs 71 [52-108] min; p = 0.004) with significantly delayed glucose disposal (108 [87-125] vs 135 [110-158] min; p = 0.005) in late gestation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Postprandial glucose control is impaired by significantly slower glucose disposal in late gestation. Early prandial insulin dosing may help to accelerate glucose disposal and potentially ameliorate postprandial hyperglycaemia in late pregnancy.
