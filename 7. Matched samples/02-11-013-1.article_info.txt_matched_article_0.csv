Case-control studies have associated blood leukocyte DNA hypomethylation with several cancers. Because samples in case-control studies are collected after disease development, whether DNA hypomethylation is causal or just associated with cancer development is still unclear. METHODS: In 722 elderly subjects from the Normative Aging Study cohort, we examined whether DNA methylation in repetitive elements (Alu, LINE-1) was associated with cancer incidence (30 new cases, median follow-up: 89 months), prevalence (205 baseline cases), and mortality (28 deaths, median follow-up: 85 months). DNA methylation was measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Individuals with low LINE-1 methylation (<median) had a 3.0-fold (95%CI 1.3-6.9) increased incidence of all cancers combined. LINE-1 and Alu methylation were not significantly associated with cancer prevalence at baseline (all cancers combined). However, individuals with low LINE-1 methylation (<median) had a 3.2-fold (95% CI 1.4-7.5) higher prevalence of lung cancer. Individuals with low LINE-1 or Alu methylation (<median) had increased cancer mortality (HR = 3.2, 95%CI 1.3-7.9 for LINE-1; HR = 2.5, 95%CI 1.1-5.8 for Alu). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that individuals with lower repetitive element methylation are at high risk of developing and dying from cancer.","Aged
