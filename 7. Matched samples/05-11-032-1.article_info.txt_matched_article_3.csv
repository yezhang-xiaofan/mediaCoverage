22075451,Long-term clinical outcomes of biodegradable polymer biolimus-eluting stents versus durable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with coronary artery disease (LEADERS): 4 year follow-up of a randomised non-inferiority trial.,Lancet,Stefanini GG and Kalesan B and Serruys PW and Heg D and Buszman P and Linke A and Ischinger T and Klauss V and Eberli F and Wijns W and Morice MC and Di Mario C and Corti R and Antoni D and Sohn HY and Eerdmans P and van Es GA and Meier B and Windecker S and Juni P,Missing,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of durable polymer drug-eluting stents comes at the expense of delayed arterial healing and subsequent late adverse events such as stent thrombosis (ST). We report the 4 year follow-up of an assessment of biodegradable polymer-based drug-eluting stents, which aim to improve safety by avoiding the persistent inflammatory stimulus of durable polymers. METHODS: We did a multicentre, assessor-masked, non-inferiority trial. Between Nov 27, 2006, and May 18, 2007, patients aged 18 years or older with coronary artery disease were randomly allocated with a computer-generated sequence to receive either biodegradable polymer biolimus-eluting stents (BES) or durable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (SES; 1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or clinically-indicated target vessel revascularisation (TVR); patients were followed-up for 4 years. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00389220. FINDINGS: 1707 patients with 2472 lesions were randomly allocated to receive either biodegradable polymer BES (857 patients, 1257 lesions) or durable polymer SES (850 patients, 1215 lesions). At 4 years, biodegradable polymer BES were non-inferior to durable polymer SES for the primary endpoint: 160 (18.7%) patients versus 192 (22.6%) patients (rate ratios [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-1.00, p for non-inferiority <0.0001, p for superiority=0.050). The RR of definite ST was 0.62 (0.35-1.08, p=0.09), which was largely attributable to a lower risk of very late definite ST between years 1 and 4 in the BES group than in the SES group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.67, p=0.004). Conversely, the RR of definite ST during the first year was 0.99 (0.51-1.95; p=0.98) and the test for interaction between RR of definite ST and time was positive (p(interaction)=0.017). We recorded an interaction with time for events associated with ST but not for other events. For primary endpoint events associated with ST, the RR was 0.86 (0.41-1.80) during the first year and 0.17 (0.04-0.78) during subsequent years (p(interaction)=0.049). INTERPRETATION: Biodegradable polymer BES are non-inferior to durable polymer SES and, by reducing the risk of cardiac events associated with very late ST, might improve long-term clinical outcomes for up to 4 years compared with durable polymer SES.
