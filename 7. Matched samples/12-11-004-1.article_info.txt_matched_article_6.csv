20978943,Ovarian function in girls and women with GALT-deficiency galactosemia.,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,Fridovich-Keil JL and Gubbels CS and Spencer JB and Sanders RD and Land JA and Rubio-Gozalbo E,emory,"Primary or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is the most common long-term complication experienced by girls and women with classic galactosemia; more than 80% and perhaps more than 90% are affected despite neonatal diagnosis and careful lifelong dietary restriction of galactose. In this review we explore the complexities of timing and detection of galactosemia-associated POI and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. Finally, we offer recommendations for follow-up care with current options for intervention.","Adolescent
