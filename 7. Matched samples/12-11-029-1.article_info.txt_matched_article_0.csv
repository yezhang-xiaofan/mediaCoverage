21692620,Human lymphoblastoid cell lines: a goldmine for the biobankomics era.,Pharmacogenomics,Nam HY and Shim SM and Han BG and Jeon JP,Missing,"Biobanking became a necessity for translating genetic discoveries into clinical practice. Approaches to personalized medicine require a new model system for functional and pharmacogenomic studies of a variety of accumulating genetic variations, as well as new research environments such as biobankomics. Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) will provide a valuable tool to meet such new demands in the biobankomics era. The National Biobank of Korea (NBK), which is leading the Korea Biobank Project, has a large collection of LCLs derived mostly from population-based cohort samples. Using a special long-term subculture collection of NBK LCLs, biological characteristics of early passage LCLs and terminally immortalized LCLs have been investigated to promote the utilization of LCLs and provide well quality-controlled LCLs for genetic and pharmacogenomic studies. As LCLs have been successfully phenotyped for cytotoxicity in response to various stimulators, including chemotherapeutic agents, environmental chemicals and irradiation, the utility of LCLs will increase in the future. Here, we discuss current and future applications of NBK LCLs for the biobankomics era.","Biological Specimen Banks/*supply & distribution
