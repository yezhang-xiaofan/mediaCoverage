23456574,"From bench to bedside: review of gene and cell-based therapies and the slow advancement into phase 3 clinical trials, with a focus on Aastrom's Ixmyelocel-T.",Stem cell reviews,Bartel RL and Booth E and Cramer C and Ledford K and Watling S and Zeigler F,Missing,"There is a large body of preclinical research demonstrating the efficacy of gene and cellular therapy for the potential treatment of severe (limb-threatening) peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including evidence for growth and transcription factors, monocytes, and mesenchymal stem cells. While preclinical research has advanced into early phase clinical trials in patients, few late-phase clinical trials have been conducted. The reasons for the slow progression of these therapies from bench to bedside are as complicated as the fields of gene and cellular therapies. The variety of tissue sources of stem cells (embryonic, adult bone marrow, umbilical cord, placenta, adipose tissue, etc.); autologous versus allogeneic donation; types of cells (hematopoietic, mesenchymal stromal, progenitor, and mixed populations); confusion and stigmatism by the public and patients regarding gene, protein, and stem cell therapy; scaling of manufacturing; and the changing regulatory environment all contribute to the small number of late phase (Phase 3) clinical trials and the lack of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals. This review article provides an overview of the progression of research from gene therapy to the cellular therapy field as it applies to peripheral arterial disease, as well as the position of Aastrom's cellular therapy, ixmyelocel-T, within this field.","Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods
