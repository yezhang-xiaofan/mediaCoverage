22052060,miR-150 as a potential biomarker associated with prognosis and therapeutic outcome in colorectal cancer.,Gut,Ma Y and Zhang P and Wang F and Zhang H and Yang J and Peng J and Liu W and Qin H,Missing,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) have potential as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. A study was undertaken to investigate the association between miRNA expression patterns and the prognosis and therapeutic outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: miRNA expression profiling in tumour, adenoma and normal colorectal tissues was performed to identify tumour-related miRNAs in the course of colorectal malignant changes. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were used to measure tumour-related miRNA and to assess its association with survival and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in 239 patients. In addition, to validate the findings, associations of the tumour-related miRNA with clinical characteristics of CRC were analysed in 185 patients by in situ hybridisation (ISH) analysis. RESULTS: Only one miR-150 was found to show a decrease in expression levels in the three tissue groups (normal, adenoma and cancer tissue) in parallel with increasing carcinogenesis of the colorectal tissue. In both ISH and qRT-PCR analysis, tumour tissue had reduced levels of miR-150 expression compared with paired non-cancerous tissue, which indicated that the levels of miR-150 expression were associated with CRC. Moreover, patients whose tumours had low miR-150 expression had shorter survival and a worse response to adjuvant chemotherapy than patients whose tumours had high miRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: The miR-150 expression status of patients with CRC is associated with survival and response to adjuvant chemotherapy. It is suggested that miR-150 should be considered as a potential biomarker associated with the prognosis and therapeutic outcome in CRC.","Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/surgery
