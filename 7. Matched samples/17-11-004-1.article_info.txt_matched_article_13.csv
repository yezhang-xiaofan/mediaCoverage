21343392,Peroxiredoxin 1 controls prostate cancer growth through Toll-like receptor 4-dependent regulation of tumor vasculature.,Cancer research,Riddell JR and Bshara W and Moser MT and Spernyak JA and Foster BA and Gollnick SO,Missing,"In recent years a number of studies have implicated chronic inflammation in prostate carcinogenesis. However, mitigating factors of inflammation in the prostate are virtually unknown. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activity is associated with inflammation and is correlated with progression risk in prostate cancer (CaP). TLR4 ligands include bacterial cell wall proteins, danger signaling proteins, and intracellular proteins such as heat shock proteins and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1). Here we show that Prx1 is overexpressed in human CaP specimens and that it regulates prostate tumor growth through TLR4-dependent regulation of prostate tumor vasculature. Inhibiting Prx1 expression in prostate tumor cells reduced tumor vascular formation and function. Furthermore, Prx1 inhibition reduced levels of angiogenic proteins such as VEGF within the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, Prx1-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in a TLR4- and VEGF-dependent manner. Taken together, these results implicate Prx1 as a tumor-derived inducer of inflammation, providing a mechanistic link between inflammation and TLR4 in prostate carcinogenesis. Our findings implicate Prx1 as a novel therapeutic target for CaP.","Animals
