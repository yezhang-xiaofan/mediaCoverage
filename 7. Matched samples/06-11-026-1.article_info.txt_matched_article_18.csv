22114936,Oleuropein ameliorates acute colitis in mice.,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Giner E and Andujar I and Recio MC and Rios JL and Cerda-Nicolas JM and Giner RM,Missing,"Oleuropein, the major secoiridoid in olive tree leaves, possesses a wide range of health promoting properties. It has recently been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. We have evaluated the effect of oleuropein on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice in order to provide insight into its mechanisms of action. Oral administration of oleuropein notably attenuated the extent and severity of acute colitis while reducing neutrophil infiltration; production of NO, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha; expression of iNOS, COX-2, and MMP-9; and the translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit to the nucleus in colon tissue. In LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, the oleuropein metabolite, hydroxytyrosol, was shown to inhibit NO production, iNOS expression, NF-kappaB p65 subunit translocation, mRNA expression, and the release of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These results suggest that the effect of oleuropein on DSS-induced colitis is associated with a decrease in the production of interleukins and expression of proteins, principally through reduction of NF-kappaB activation.","Acute Disease
