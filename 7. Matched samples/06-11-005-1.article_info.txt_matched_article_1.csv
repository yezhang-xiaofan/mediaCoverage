21266976,Cytology history preceding cervical cancer diagnosis: a regional analysis of 286 cases.,British journal of cancer,Gok M and Rozendaal L and Berkhof J and Visser O and Meijer CJ and van Kemenade FJ,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Despite programmed screening in the Netherlands, the decrease in incidence of cervical carcinoma lags behind. We analysed screening results preceding carcinoma cases, timeliness in case of follow-up, and FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) stages as efficiency parameters for screening were taken. METHODS: We analysed 286 women with cervical cancer between 2005 and 2007 for cytology history preceding carcinoma, hierarchically arranging cytology history (if present) into three groups: 'screened', 'work-up', and 'underscreened' (>6 yrs before diagnosis). For screen- and work-up smears, we analysed timeliness. FIGO stage was measured in relation to cytology history. RESULTS: A total of 105 out of 286 (36.7%) women with cervical carcinoma were screened preceding the diagnosis. Delayed time intervals in case of abnormal cytology were 43.5% for borderline/mild dyskaryosis (BMD) and 38.0% for BMD (moderate dyskaryosis or worse; P=0.51). A total of 108 out of 286 (36.4%) women were underscreened, and 73 out of 286 (25.5%) were unscreened. Advanced carcinoma or FIGO stage >/=2B in screened women was 16.0 vs 48.7% in work-up, underscreened, or unscreened (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Women with cervical cancer are underscreened and have poor timeliness in case of abnormal cytology. Being un- or underscreened correlates significantly with higher cervical cancer stages, especially in older women (aged >/=49 years; P<0.001). Improvement of attendancy is needed to meet the standard of quality for screening programmes.","Adult
