21540553,IL-6 promotes nonthyroidal illness syndrome by blocking thyroxine activation while promoting thyroid hormone inactivation in human cells.,The Journal of clinical investigation,Wajner SM and Goemann IM and Bueno AL and Larsen PR and Maia AL,Missing,"Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is a state of low serum 3,5,3' triiodothyronine (T(3)) that occurs in chronically ill patients; the degree of reduction in T(3) is associated with overall prognosis and survival. Iodthyronine deiodinases are enzymes that catalyze iodine removal from thyroid hormones; type I and II deiodinase (D1 and D2, respectively) convert the prohormone thyroxine T(4) to active T(3), whereas the type III enzyme (D3) inactivates T(4) and T(3). Increased production of cytokines, including IL-6, is a hallmark of the acute phase of NTIS, but the role of cytokines in altered thyroid hormone metabolism is poorly understood. Here, we measured the effect of IL-6 on both endogenous cofactor-mediated and dithiothreitol-stimulated (DTT-stimulated) cell sonicate deiodinase activities in human cell lines. Active T(3) generation by D1 and D2 in intact cells was suppressed by IL-6, despite an increase in sonicate deiodinases (and mRNAs). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant that restores intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations, prevented the IL-6-induced inhibitory effect on D1- and D2-mediated T(3) production, which suggests that IL-6 might function by depleting an intracellular thiol cofactor, perhaps GSH. In contrast, IL-6 stimulated endogenous D3-mediated inactivation of T(3). Taken together, these results identify a single pathway by which IL-6-induced oxidative stress can reduce D1- and D2-mediated T(4)-to-T(3) conversion as well as increasing D3-mediated T(3) (and T(4)) inactivation, thus mimicking events during illness.","Acetylcysteine/chemistry
