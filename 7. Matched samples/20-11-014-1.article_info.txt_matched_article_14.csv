22064432,"Arterial thrombosis--insidious, unpredictable and deadly.",Nature medicine,Jackson SP,monash,"The formation of blood clots--thrombosis--at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a major clinical problem despite ongoing improvements in antithrombotic therapy. Progress in identifying the pathogenic mechanisms regulating arterial thrombosis has led to the development of newer therapeutics, and there is general anticipation that these treatments will have greater efficacy and improved safety. However, major advances in this field require the identification of specific risk factors for arterial thrombosis in affected individuals and a rethink of the 'one size fits all' approach to antithrombotic therapy.","Acute Coronary Syndrome/etiology/pathology
