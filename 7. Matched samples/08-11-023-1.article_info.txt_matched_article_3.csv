22001065,The influence of chlorhexidine on the remineralization of demineralized dentine.,Journal of dentistry,Kim DS and Kim J and Choi KK and Kim SY,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the differences in the amounts of bound chlorhexidine (CHX) on demineralized dentine blocks and to investigate the different aspects of remineralization of demineralized dentine according to different concentrations of CHX. METHODS: Dentine blocks (2 mm x 7 mm x 0.9 m) were demineralized in 0.2 M formic acid solution. Amount of bound CHX on the dentine blocks was measured on a spectrophotometer after the dentine block was soaked in 0.02%, 0.2%, or 2% CHX solutions for 1 min. The change in elastic modulus of dentine block stored in simulated body fluids was measured at 0 (baseline), 2, 4, and 6 weeks after storage. The micromorphological aspects of the samples were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope after 6 weeks of storage. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of CHX caused a greater amount of CHX to bind to the dentine blocks (p<0.05). The group treated with the higher concentration of CHX had a smaller decrease in the elastic modulus at 2 weeks and a greater increase at 4 and 6 weeks. Dentine specimens with the 0.2% and 2% CHX had a greater deposition of granular minerals along the collagen fibrils compared to the 0.02% CHX-treated group. CONCLUSION: The application of the 0.2% and 2% CHX seemed to be effective in promoting the remineralization of demineralized dentine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The application of the 0.2% and 2% CHX positively influences on the dentine remineralization.","Anti-Infective Agents, Local/administration & dosage/*pharmacology
