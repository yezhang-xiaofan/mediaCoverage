21339289,Critical role for CD38-mediated Ca2+ signaling in thrombin-induced procoagulant activity of mouse platelets and hemostasis.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Mushtaq M and Nam TS and Kim UH,Missing,"CD38, a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular Ca(2+) messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), is known to be expressed on platelets. However, the role of CD38 in platelets remains unclear. Our present results show that treatment of platelets with thrombin results in a rapid and sustained Ca(2+) signal, resulting from a coordinated interplay of Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cADPR, and NAADP. By dissecting the signaling pathway using various agents, we delineated that cADPR and NAADP are sequentially produced through CD38 internalization by protein kinase C via myosin heavy chain IIA following phospholipase C activation in thrombin-induced platelets. An inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist blocked the thrombin-induced formation of cADPR and NAADP as well as Ca(2+) signals. An indispensable response of platelets relying on cytosolic calcium is the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which implicates platelet procoagulant activity. Scrutinizing this parameter reveals that CD38(+/+) platelets fully express PS on the surface when stimulated with thrombin, whereas this response was decreased on CD38(-/-) platelets. Similarly, PS exposure and Ca(2+) signals were attenuated when platelets were incubated with 8-bromo-cADPR, bafilomycin A1, and a PKC inhibitor. Furthermore, in vivo, CD38-deficient mice exhibited longer bleeding times and unstable formation of thrombus than wild type mice. These results demonstrate that CD38 plays an essential role in thrombin-induced procoagulant activity of platelets and hemostasis via Ca(2+) signaling mediated by its products, cADPR and NAADP.","Animals
