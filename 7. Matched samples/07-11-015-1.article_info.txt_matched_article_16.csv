21490402,Loss of TFF1 is associated with activation of NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation and gastric neoplasia in mice and humans.,The Journal of clinical investigation,Soutto M and Belkhiri A and Piazuelo MB and Schneider BG and Peng D and Jiang A and Washington MK and Kokoye Y and Crowe SE and Zaika A and Correa P and Peek RM Jr and El-Rifai W,Missing,"Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a peptide belonging to the trefoil factor family of protease-resistant peptides. Although TFF1 expression is frequently lost in gastric carcinomas, the tumorigenic pathways this affects have not been determined. Here we show that Tff1-knockout mice exhibit age-dependent carcinogenic histological changes in the pyloric antrum of the gastric mucosa, progressing from gastritis to hyperplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and ultimately malignant adenocarcinoma. The histology and molecular signatures of gastric lesions in the Tff1-knockout mice were consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. In vivo, ex-vivo, and in vitro studies showed that TFF1 expression suppressed TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation through the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)/IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathway. Consistent with these mouse data, human gastric tissue samples displayed a progressive decrease in TFF1 expression and an increase in NF-kappaB activation along the multi-step carcinogenesis cascade. Collectively, these results provide evidence that loss of TFF1 leads to activation of IKK complex-regulated NF-kappaB transcription factors and is an important event in shaping the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory response during the progression to gastric tumorigenesis.","Animals
