We therefore tested the effects of GA on the catabolic activities of osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes. DESIGN: Primary human chondrocytes and OA cartilage explants were utilized in this study. IL-1Ra, pro-matrix metalloproteinase-13 (proMMP-13) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) were estimated in the cell culture supernatants and in vitro MMP-13 activity was measured using fluorogenic substrate. TaqMan Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to estimate relative expression levels of genes. RESULTS: GA treatment significantly increased transcription and production of sIL-1Ra (P=0.001) in both culture models. Furthermore, addition of GA (100 mug) inhibited: (1) spontaneous collagen degradation as assayed by CTX II enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [mean CTX II (ng/g cartilage)] in control was 7.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-13.02]-3.415 (95% CI 0.81-6.02) (P=0.0286); (2) spontaneous proMMP-13 secretion [mean MMP-13 (ng/g cartilage)] in control was 16.98 (95% CI 7.739-26.23)-6.973 (95% CI 1.632-12.31) (P=0.0286); (3) production of IL-1beta-induced inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) [mean NO (muM)] in IL-1 cultures was 11.47 (95% CI 7.10-15.83)-0.87 (95% CI 0.18-1.56) (P=0.0022); and (4) recombinant MMP-13 in vitro activity (15-25%; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that GA effects may be due to upregulation of IL-1Ra as well as direct inhibition of MMP-13 activity. Based on these studies, we propose that GA has potential for disease modifying properties in OA and should be evaluated in vivo in animal studies.","Aged
