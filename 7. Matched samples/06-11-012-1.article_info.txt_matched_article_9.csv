Identification of biological markers that can predict prognosis in individual patients is of great clinical value. PROX1 is a transcription factor that has a critical role in the development of various organs. PROX1 has been ascribed both oncogenic and tumour suppressive functions in human cancers. We have recently shown that PROX1 may act as a diagnostic marker for high-grade gliomas. The aim of this study was to address the prognostic value of PROX1 in grade II gliomas. METHODS: A total of 116 samples were evaluated for the presence of PROX1 protein. The number of immunopositive cells was used as a variable in survival analysis, together with established prognostic factors for this patient group. RESULTS: Higher PROX1 protein was associated with poor outcome. In the multivariate analysis, PROX1 was identified as an independent factor for survival (P=0.024), together with the presence of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 R132H protein, and with combined losses of chromosomal arms 1p/19q in oligodendrocytic tumours. CONCLUSION: PROX1 is a novel predictor of survival for grade II gliomas.","Adult
