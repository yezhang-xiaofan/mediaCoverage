22124606,Plasma deoxysphingolipids: a novel class of biomarkers for the metabolic syndrome?,Diabetologia,Othman A and Rutti MF and Ernst D and Saely CH and Rein P and Drexel H and Porretta-Serapiglia C and Lauria G and Bianchi R and von Eckardstein A and Hornemann T,Missing,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sphingolipid synthesis is typically initiated by the conjugation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA, a reaction catalysed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). SPT can also metabolise other acyl-CoAs (C(12) to C(18)) and other amino acids such as L-alanine and glycine, giving rise to a spectrum of atypical sphingolipids. Here, we aimed to identify changes in plasma levels of these atypical sphingolipids to explore their potential as biomarkers in the metabolic syndrome and diabetes. METHODS: We compared the plasma profiles of ten sphingoid bases in healthy individuals with those of patients with the metabolic syndrome but not diabetes, and diabetic patients (n = 25 per group). The results were verified in a streptozotocin (STZ) rat model. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used. RESULTS: Deoxysphingolipids (dSLs) were significantly elevated (p = 5 x 10(-)(6)) in patients with the metabolic syndrome (0.11 +/- 0.04 mumol/l) compared with controls (0.06 +/- 0.02 mumol/l) but did not differ between the metabolic syndrome and diabetes groups. Levels of C(16)-sphingosine-based sphingolipids were significantly lowered in diabetic patients but not in patients with the metabolic syndrome but without diabetes (p = 0.008). Significantly elevated dSL levels were also found in the plasma and liver of STZ rats. A principal component analysis revealed a similar or even closer association of dSLs with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in comparison with the established biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We showed that dSLs are significantly elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic metabolic syndrome compared with healthy controls. They may, therefore, be useful novel biomarkers to improve risk prediction and therapy monitoring in these patients.","Aged
