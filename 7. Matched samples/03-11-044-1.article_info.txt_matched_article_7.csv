22184633,Loss of the signaling adaptor TRAF1 causes CD8+ T cell dysregulation during human and murine chronic infection.,The Journal of experimental medicine,Wang C and McPherson AJ and Jones RB and Kawamura KS and Lin GH and Lang PA and Ambagala T and Pellegrini M and Calzascia T and Aidarus N and Elford AR and Yue FY and Kremmer E and Kovacs CM and Benko E and Tremblay C and Routy JP and Bernard NF and Ostrowski MA and Ohashi PS and Watts TH,Missing,"The signaling adaptor TNFR-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) is specifically lost from virus-specific CD8 T cells during the chronic phase of infection with HIV in humans or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 in mice. In contrast, TRAF1 is maintained at higher levels in virus-specific T cells of HIV controllers or after acute LCMV infection. TRAF1 expression negatively correlates with programmed death 1 expression and HIV load and knockdown of TRAF1 in CD8 T cells from viral controllers results in decreased HIV suppression ex vivo. Consistent with the desensitization of the TRAF1-binding co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB, 4-1BBL-deficient mice have defects in viral control early, but not late, in chronic infection. TGFbeta induces the posttranslational loss of TRAF1, whereas IL-7 restores TRAF1 levels. A combination treatment with IL-7 and agonist anti-4-1BB antibody at 3 wk after LCMV clone 13 infection expands T cells and reduces viral load in a TRAF1-dependent manner. Moreover, transfer of TRAF1(+) but not TRAF1(-) memory T cells at the chronic stage of infection reduces viral load. These findings identify TRAF1 as a potential biomarker of HIV-specific CD8 T cell fitness during the chronic phase of disease and a target for therapy.","4-1BB Ligand/immunology/metabolism
