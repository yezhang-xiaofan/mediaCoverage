21203819,SNP variations in the 7q33 region containing DGKI are associated with dyslexia in the Finnish and German populations.,Behavior genetics,Matsson H and Tammimies K and Zucchelli M and Anthoni H and Onkamo P and Nopola-Hemmi J and Lyytinen H and Leppanen PH and Neuhoff N and Warnke A and Schulte-Korne G and Schumacher J and Nothen MM and Kere J and Peyrard-Janvid M,Missing,"Four genes, DYX1C1, ROBO1, DCDC2 and KIAA0319 have been studied both genetically and functionally as candidate genes for developmental dyslexia, a common learning disability in children. The identification of novel genes is crucial to better understand the molecular pathways affected in dyslectic individuals. Here, we report results from a fine-mapping approach involving linkage and association analysis in Finnish and German dyslexic cohorts. We restrict a candidate region to 0.3 Mb on chromosome 7q33. This region harbours the gene diacylglycerol kinase, iota (DGKI) which contains overlapping haplotypes associated with dyslexia in both Finnish and German sample sets.","*Alleles
