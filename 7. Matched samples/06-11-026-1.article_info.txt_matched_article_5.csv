22107158,Study of an online molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction coupled to chemiluminescence sensor for the determination of trichlorfon in vegetables.,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Meng L and Qiao X and Song J and Xu Z and Xin J and Zhang Y,Missing,"This study reports a new online molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction coupled to chemiluminescence for the determination of trichlorfon. This molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared through bulk polymerization, in which methacrylic acid (MAA) was used as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker. This novel functionalized material was characterized by FT-IR spectra and adsorption, and it exhibited good recognition and selective ability and fast adsorption-desorption dynamics toward trichlorfon. The factors affecting preconcentration of the analytes and sensitivity of the method are discussed in detail. Under the optimal condition, the linear range of the calibration graph was between 0.02 and 1.0 ng L(-1), and the detection limit was 1 x 10(3) ng L(-1). The blank cucumber samples spiked with trichlorfon at three levels were extracted and determined by the presented method with recoveries ranging from 83.5 to 94.5%, and the results were correlated well with those obtained using gas chromatography. Moreover, this developed method was successfully applied to the quantitative detection of trichlorfon residues in leek samples.","Food Contamination/analysis
