22106155,Cellular mechanisms of restored beta-cell tolerance mediated by protective alleles of Idd3 and Idd5.,Diabetes,Hamilton-Williams EE and Cheung J and Rainbow DB and Hunter KM and Wicker LS and Sherman LA,Missing,"Type 1 diabetes genes within the interleukin (IL)-2, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte--associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP1) pathways influence development of autoimmune diabetes in humans and NOD mice. In NOD mice, when present together, protective alleles encoding IL-2, Idd3 candidate gene, CTLA-4, NRAMP1, and acetyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long-chain (ACADL) (candidate genes for the Idd5.1, Idd5.2, and Idd5.3 subregions) provide nearly complete diabetes protection. To define where the protective alleles of Idd3 and the Idd5 subregions must be present to protect from diabetes and tolerize islet-specific CD8(+) T cells, SCID mice were reconstituted so that the host and lymphocytes expressed various combinations of protective and susceptibility alleles at Idd3 and Idd5. Although protective Idd3 alleles in the lymphocytes and protective Idd5 alleles in the SCID host contributed most significantly to CD8 tolerance, both were required together in both lymphocyte and nonlymphocyte cells to recapitulate the potent diabetes protection observed in intact Idd3/5 mice. We conclude that genetic regions involved in autoimmune disease are not restricted in their influence to individual cell types. Even a single protective gene product, such as IL-2, must be expressed in both the lymphocytes and dendritic cells to exert its full extent of disease protection. These studies highlight the pleiotropic effects of genes that determine autoimmune disease susceptibility.","Alleles
