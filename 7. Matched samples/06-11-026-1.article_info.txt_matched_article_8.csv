22053776,Factors influencing benzene formation from the decarboxylation of benzoate in liquid model systems.,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Medeiros Vinci R and De Meulenaer B and Andjelkovic M and Canfyn M and Van Overmeire I and Van Loco J,Missing,"Benzene may occur in foods due to the oxidative decarboxylation of benzoate in the presence of hydroxyl radicals. This study investigated factors influencing benzene formation in liquid model systems. The type of buffer, other sources of hydroxyl radical formation in food (photo oxidation of riboflavin and lipid oxidation), transition metal ion concentrations, and the inhibitory effect of antioxidants were tested in benzoate containing model systems. Regarding the hydroxyl radical sources tested, the highest benzene formation was observed in light exposed model systems containing ascorbic acid, Cu(2+), and riboflavin in Na-citrate buffer (1250 +/- 131 mug kg(-1)). In practice, it seems that the combination ascorbic acid/transition metal ion remains the biggest contributor to benzene formation in food. However, the concentration of Cu(2+) influences significantly benzene formation in such a system with highest benzene yields observed for Cu(2+) 50 muM (1400 mug kg(-1)). The presence of antioxidants with metal chelation or reduction properties could prevent completely benzene formation.","Antioxidants/pharmacology
