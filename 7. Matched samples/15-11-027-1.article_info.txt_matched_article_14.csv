21799245,4-O-methylhonokiol attenuated memory impairment through modulation of oxidative damage of enzymes involving amyloid-beta generation and accumulation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Choi IS and Lee YJ and Choi DY and Lee YK and Lee YH and Kim KH and Kim YH and Jeon YH and Kim EH and Han SB and Jung JK and Yun YP and Oh KW and Hwang DY and Hong JT,Missing,"Accumulations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and oxidative damage are critical pathological mechanisms in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that 4-O-methylhonokiol, a compound extracted from Magnolia officinalis, improved memory dysfunction in Abeta-injected and presenilin 2 mutant mice through the reduction of accumulated Abeta. To investigate mechanisms of the reduced Abeta accumulation, we examined generation, degradation, efflux and aggregation of Abeta in Swedish AbetaPP AD model (AbetaPPsw) mice pre-treated with 4-O-methylhonokiol (1.0 mg/kg) for 3 months. 4-O-methylhonokiol treatment recovered memory impairment and prevented neuronal cell death. This memory improving activity was associated with 4-O-methylhonokiol-induced reduction of Abeta1-42 accumulation in the brains of AbetaPPsw mice. According to the reduction of Abeta1-42 accumulation, 4-O-methylhonkiol modulated oxidative damage sensitive enzymes. 4-O-methylhonkiol decreased expression and activity of brain beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), but increased clearance of Abeta in the brain through an increase of expressions and activities of Abeta degradation enzymes; insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin. 4-O-methylhonkiol also increased expression of Abeta transport molecule, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 in the brain and liver. 4-O-methylhonkiol decreased carbonyl protein and lipid peroxidation, but increased glutathione levels in the brains of AbetaPPsw mice suggesting that oxidative damage of protein and lipid is critical in the impairment of those enzyme activities. 4-O-methylhonokiol treatment also prevented neuronal cell death in the AbetaPPsw mousee brain through inactivation of caspase-3 and BAX. These results suggest that 4-O-methylhonokiol might prevent the development and progression of AD by reducing Abeta accumulation through an increase of clearance and decrease of Abeta generation via antioxidant mechanisms.","Alzheimer Disease/*complications/genetics
