Because the specificity, prevalence, and importance of antibodies to non-HLA antigens in late allograft injury are poorly characterized, we used a protein microarray to compare antibody repertoires in pre- and post-transplant sera from several cohorts of patients with and without transplant glomerulopathy. Transplantation routinely induced changes in antibody repertoires, but we did not identify any de novo non-HLA antibodies common to patients with transplant glomerulopathy. The screening studies identified three reactivities present before transplantation that persisted after transplant and strongly associated with transplant glomerulopathy. ELISA confirmed that reactivity against peroxisomal-trans-2-enoyl-coA-reductase strongly associated with the development of transplant glomerulopathy in independent validation sets. In addition to providing insight into effects of transplantation on non-HLA antibody repertoires, these results suggest that pretransplant serum antibodies to peroxisomal-trans-2-enoyl-coA-reductase may predict prognosis in kidney transplantation.","Adolescent
