22092931,Periodontitis in non-smoking type 1 diabetic adults: a cross-sectional study.,Journal of clinical periodontology,Hodge PJ and Robertson D and Paterson K and Smith GL and Creanor S and Sherriff A,Missing,"AIM: To compare levels of periodontitis in non-smoking type 1 diabetic patients and controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Type 1 diabetic patients, aged 20-55 years, were recruited from outpatient clinics at five hospitals in Glasgow, UK. Control subjects were recruited from physiotherapy clinics, using the buddy system and through an advertisement in a free newspaper. The primary outcome was severe periodontitis defined by clinical attachment level >/=6 mm on >/=1 tooth. RESULTS: There were 34 well controlled patients (HbA1c </= 7.5%), 169 poorly controlled patients and 112 non-diabetic subjects. Prevalence of severe periodontitis was higher in all type 1 diabetic patients [24.1% (95% CI: 18.4-30.6%)] and poorly controlled patients [27.2% (20.7-34.6%)] than in controls [20.5% (13.5-29.2%)]. The fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) in never smokers comparing the whole diabetic group, and the poorly controlled group, with the control group were 1.35 [0.66-2.8] (p = 0.41) and 1.58 [0.75-3.33] (p = 0.23), respectively. Mean clinical attachment level was higher in all type 1 diabetic and poorly controlled patients than in controls (both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate worse periodontal health in type 1 diabetic patients than in control subjects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the UKCRN, ID: 9314 and Scottish Diabetes Research Network registration number: 128.","Adult
