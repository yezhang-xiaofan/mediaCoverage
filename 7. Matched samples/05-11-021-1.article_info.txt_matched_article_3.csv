As a first proof of concept we evaluated the potential of a murine iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor population, which expresses the surface marker foetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1), to restore myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: iPSC-derived Flk-1(pos) vs. Flk-1(neg) cells were selected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and injected into the ischaemic myocardium of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)-ligated mice. Addressing safety aspects we used an octamer binding factor 4 (Oct4)-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expressing iPSC clone from the transgenic Oct4-eGFP reporter mouse strain OG2 to enable FACS-based depletion of undifferentiated cells prior to transplantation. Infarcted animals were treated with placebo (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 13), Flk-1(neg) cells (n = 14), or Flk-1(pos) cells (n = 11; 5 x 10(5) cells each). Heart function was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and conductance catheter analysis 2 weeks postoperatively. Cardiovascular in vitro and in vivo differentiations were investigated by immunofluorescence staining. Treatment with Flk-1(pos) and Flk-1(neg) cells resulted in a favourable myocardial remodelling and improved left ventricular function. Engraftment and functional benefits were superior after transplantation of Flk-1(pos) compared with Flk-1(neg) cells. Furthermore, Flk-1(pos) grafts contained considerably more vascular structures in relation to Flk-1(neg) grafts. CONCLUSION: iPSC-derived Flk-1(pos) progenitor cells differentiate into cardiovascular lineages in vitro and in vivo and improve cardiac function after acute MI. This proof of concept study paves the way for an autologous iPSC-based therapy of MI.","Animals
