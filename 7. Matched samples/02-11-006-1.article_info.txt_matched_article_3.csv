20581718,Knee joint laxity and its cyclic variation influence tibiofemoral motion during weight acceptance.,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,Shultz SJ and Schmitz RJ and Nguyen AD and Levine B and Kim H and Montgomery MM and Shimokochi Y and Beynnon BD and Perrin DH,uncg,"PURPOSE: to better understand how sex differences in anterior knee laxity (AKL) affect knee joint biomechanics, we examined the consequence of greater absolute baseline (males and females) and cyclic increases in AKL during the menstrual cycle (females) on anterior tibial translation (ATT) as the knee transitioned from non-weight-bearing to weight-bearing conditions, while also controlling for genu recurvatum (GR). METHODS: males and females (71 females and 48 males, aged 18-30 yr) were measured for AKL and GR and underwent measurement of ATT. Women were tested on the days of their cycle when AKL was at its minimum (T1) and maximum (T2); males were matched in time to a female with similar AKL. Linear regressions examined relationships between absolute baseline (AKLT1, GRT1) and cyclic changes (Delta = T2 - T1; AKLDelta, GRDelta) (females only) in knee laxity with ATT as measured at T1 and T2 and Delta (T2 - T1) (females only). RESULTS: AKL and GR increased in females, but not in males, from T1 to T2. Greater AKLT1 and GRT1 predicted greater ATTT1 and ATTT2 in males (R = 21.0, P < 0.007). The combination of greater AKLT1, AKLDelta, and less GRDelta predicted greater ATTT1 and ATTT2 in females (R = 12.5-13.1, P < 0.05), with AKLDelta being a stronger predictor (coefficient, P value) of ATTT2 (0.864, P = 0.027) compared with ATTT1 (0.333, P = 0.370). AKLDelta was the sole predictor of ATTDelta (R = 0.104 and 0.740, P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: greater absolute baseline and cyclic increases in AKL were consistently associated with greater ATT produced by transition of the knee from non-weight-bearing to weight-bearing. Because the anterior cruciate ligament is the primary restraint to ATT, these findings provide insight into the possible mechanisms by which greater AKL may be associated with at-risk knee biomechanics during the weight acceptance phase of dynamic tasks.","Adolescent
