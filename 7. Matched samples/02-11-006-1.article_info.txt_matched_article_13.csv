However, the majority of these laboratory studies used cycling as the mode of exercise, and it is not known whether these results can be extrapolated to running. PURPOSE: the purpose of this study was to investigate exogenous CHO oxidation from a CHO drink during moderate-intensity running (RUN) compared with cycling (CYCLE). METHODS: eight athletes with comparable CYCLE and RUN training backgrounds (mean +/- SD: age = 37 +/- 7 yr, weight = 75 +/- 7 kg, height = 1.77 +/- 0.05 m; V O2max CYCLE = 63 +/- 3 mL.kg.min, V O2max RUN = 65 +/- 4 mL.kg.min) performed four exercise trials in random order. The trials consisted of either running or cycling at approximately 60% of the exercise specific V O2max for 120 min while receiving either a CHO drink (2:1 glucose-fructose blend; 1.5 g.min) or a similar volume of plain water (WAT; 675 mL.h). RESULTS: the set workload elicited similar relative exercise intensities of 59.7% +/- 2.0% and 59.2% +/- 1.9% V O2max for RUN and CYCLE, respectively. Peak and average exogenous CHO oxidation rates were not significantly different between RUN and CYCLE trials and showed a similar time course (peak at 120 min = 1.25 +/- 0.10 vs 1.19 +/- 0.08 g.min, respectively, P = 0.13; average over final hour = 1.14 +/- 0.10 and 1.11 +/- 0.11 g.min, respectively, P = 0.94). Furthermore, total fat oxidation rates were higher during RUN compared with CYCLE. The difference was significant with ingestion of WAT (P = 0.02) and failed to reach statistical significance with CHO (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: this study demonstrates that exogenous CHO oxidation rates are similar between prolonged running and cycling at a similar relative moderate intensity. These data suggest that previous exogenous CHO oxidation results from cycling studies can be extrapolated to running.","Adult
