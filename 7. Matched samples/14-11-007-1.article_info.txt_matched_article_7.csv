21444594,Provider demonstration and assessment of child device technique during pediatric asthma visits.,Pediatrics,Sleath B and Ayala GX and Gillette C and Williams D and Davis S and Tudor G and Yeatts K and Washington D,unc,"OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to (a) describe the extent to which children use metered dose inhalers, turbuhalers, diskuses, and peak flow meters correctly, and (b) investigate how often providers assess and demonstrate use of metered dose inhalers, turbuinhalers, diskuses, and peak flow meters during pediatric asthma visits. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children ages 8 through 16 with mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma and their caregivers were recruited at 5 pediatric practices in nonurban areas of North Carolina. All of the medical visits were audiotape-recorded. Children were interviewed after their medical visits, and their device technique was observed and rated by the research assistants. RESULTS: Of the patients, 296 had useable audiotape data. Only 8.1% of children performed all of the metered dose inhaler steps correctly. Older children were more likely to get more of the metered dose inhaler steps correct. Of the children, 22% performed all of the diskus steps correctly, 15.6% performed all of the turbuhaler steps correctly, and 24% performed all of the peak flow meter steps correctly. The majority of providers did not demonstrate or assess child use of metered dose inhalers, turbuhalers, diskuses, or peak flow meters during pediatric asthma visits. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for providers to demonstrate proper asthma medication and monitoring device techniques to children and to have children demonstrate to proficiency. The 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel report on the diagnosis and management of asthma encourages providers to educate children on these techniques.","Adolescent
