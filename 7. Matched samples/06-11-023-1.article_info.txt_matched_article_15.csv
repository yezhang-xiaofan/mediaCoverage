METHODS: The study cohort included 732 revascularisation procedures performed in 597 diabetic patients with ulcer or gangrene. Logistic regression and CART analysis were used for identification of predictors of 1-year outcome. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that chronic kidney disease (CKD) class (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16, 1.65) was an independent predictor of 1-year leg salvage (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0.60, 95% CI 0.54, 0.65). The terminal nodes of the CART for 1-year leg salvage were CKD classes 4-5, the level (infrapopliteal vs femoropopliteal revascularisation), type of revascularisation (bypass surgery vs percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) and gangrene (area under the ROC curve 0.62, 95% CI 0.57, 0.68). Logistic regression showed that pulmonary disease (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11, 2.78), CKD class (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.24, 1.65), foot gangrene (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.21, 2.60) and patient age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01, 1.04) were independent predictors of 1-year amputation-free survival (area under the ROC curve 0.65, 95% CI 0.60, 0.69). The terminal nodes of the CART for 1-year amputation-free survival were CKD classes 3-5, patient's age of >/= 75 years and foot gangrene (area under the ROC curve 0.64, 95% CI 0.60, 0.68). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CKD is a formidable risk factor for poor intermediate outcome after infrainguinal revascularisation in diabetic patients with foot ulcer or gangrene. CART analysis indicates that foot gangrene is also a significant risk factor for adverse outcome.","Aged
