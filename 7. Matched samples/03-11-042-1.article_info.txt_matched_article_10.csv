21994967,The effect of hypoxia and work intensity on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Mackenzie R and Elliott B and Maxwell N and Brickley G and Watt P,Missing,"CONTEXT: Hypoxia and muscle contraction stimulate glucose transport in vitro. We have previously demonstrated that exercise and hypoxia have an additive effect on insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the effects of three different hypoxic/exercise (Hy Ex) trials on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in the 48 h after acute hypoxia in type 2 diabetics. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Eight male type 2 diabetics completed 60 min of hypoxic [mean (sem) O(2) = approximately 14.7 (0.2)%] exercise at 90% of lactate threshold [Hy Ex(60); 49 (1) W]. Patients completed an additional two hypoxic trials of equal work, lasting 40 min [Hy Ex(40); 70 (1) W] and 20 min [Hy Ex(20); 140 (12) W]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glucose rate of appearance and rate of disappearance were determined using the one-compartment minimal model. Homeostasis models of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)), fasting insulin resistance index and beta-cell function (HOMA(beta-cell)) were calculated at 24 and 48 h after trials. RESULTS: Peak glucose rate of appearance was highest during Hy Ex(20) [8.89 (0.56) mg/kg . min, P < 0.05]. HOMA(IR) and fasting insulin resistance index were improved in the 24 and 48 h after Hy Ex(60) and Hy Ex(40) (P < 0.05). HOMA(IR) decreased 24 h after Hy Ex(20) (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline values at 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity exercise in hypoxia (Hy Ex(60) and Hy Ex(40)) stimulates acute- and moderate-term improvements in insulin sensitivity that were less apparent in Hy Ex(20). Results suggest that exercise duration and not total work completed has a greater influence on acute and moderate-term glucose control in type 2 diabetics.","Adult
