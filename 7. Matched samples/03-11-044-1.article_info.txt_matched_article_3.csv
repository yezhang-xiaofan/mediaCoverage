22213805,Rapid monocyte kinetics in acute myocardial infarction are sustained by extramedullary monocytopoiesis.,The Journal of experimental medicine,Leuschner F and Rauch PJ and Ueno T and Gorbatov R and Marinelli B and Lee WW and Dutta P and Wei Y and Robbins C and Iwamoto Y and Sena B and Chudnovskiy A and Panizzi P and Keliher E and Higgins JM and Libby P and Moskowitz MA and Pittet MJ and Swirski FK and Weissleder R and Nahrendorf M,Missing,"Monocytes (Mo) and macrophages (MPhi) are emerging therapeutic targets in malignant, cardiovascular, and autoimmune disorders. Targeting of Mo/MPhi and their effector functions without compromising innate immunity's critical defense mechanisms first requires addressing gaps in knowledge about the life cycle of these cells. Here we studied the source, tissue kinetics, and clearance of Mo/MPhi in murine myocardial infarction, a model of acute inflammation after ischemic injury. We found that a) Mo tissue residence time was surprisingly short (20 h); b) Mo recruitment rates were consistently high even days after initiation of inflammation; c) the sustained need of newly made Mo was fostered by extramedullary monocytopoiesis in the spleen; d) splenic monocytopoiesis was regulated by IL-1beta; and e) the balance of cell recruitment and local death shifted during resolution of inflammation. Depending on the experimental approach, we measured a 24 h Mo/MPhi exit rate from infarct tissue between 5 and 13% of the tissue cell population. Exited cells were most numerous in the blood, liver, and spleen. Abrogation of extramedullary monocytopoiesis proved deleterious for infarct healing and accelerated the evolution of heart failure. We also detected rapid Mo kinetics in mice with stroke. These findings expand our knowledge of Mo/MPhi flux in acute inflammation and provide the groundwork for novel anti-inflammatory strategies for treating heart failure.","Adoptive Transfer
