22066753,Behavior of protein in the presence of calcium during heating of whey protein concentrate solutions.,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Riou E and Havea P and McCarthy O and Watkinson P and Singh H,Missing,"The effect of added CaCl(2) on heat-induced changes in whey protein (WP) solutions prepared from whey protein isolate (WP1), acid whey protein concentrate (WP2), and cheese whey protein concentrate (WP3) was investigated. The loss of native-like, proteins, aggregation, and gel firmness of WP were maximum at certain levels of added CaCl(2). These levels were different for different WP products. The effect of added CaCl(2) on these changes appeared to be related to the initial calcium concentrations of these solutions. The higher the calcium content of the product, the less available sites for added CaCl(2) to bind. It was considered that addition of CaCl(2) changed the types of protein interactions that formed the protein aggregates during heating. Added calcium caused dramatic decreases in fracture stress of WP gels due to the formation of large protein aggregates.","Calcium/analysis
