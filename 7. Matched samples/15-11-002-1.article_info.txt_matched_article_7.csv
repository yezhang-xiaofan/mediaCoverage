21126274,Why do stigmas move in a flexistylous plant?,Journal of evolutionary biology,Sun S and Zhang DY and Ives AR and Li QJ,Missing,"Flexistyly is a recently documented stylar polymorphism involving both spatial and temporal segregation of sex roles within hermaphroditic flowers. Using the experimental manipulation of stigma movement in self-compatible Alpinia mutica, we tested the hypothesis that selection for reducing interference between male and female function drives the evolution and/or maintenance of stigma movement. In experimental arrays, anaflexistylous (protogynous) flowers served as pollen donors competing for mating opportunities on cataflexistylous (protandrous) flowers. The pollen donors were either manipulated so their stigmas could not move or were left intact, and their success was determined using allozymes to assess the paternity of recipient seeds. We found that manipulated flowers sired a significantly smaller proportion of seeds, showing that stigma movement in unmanipulated plants increased male fitness. This result was strongest under conditions in which pollen competition was expected to be highest, specifically when pollinators visited multiple donor plants before visiting recipient flowers.","Alpinia/*anatomy & histology/genetics/*physiology
