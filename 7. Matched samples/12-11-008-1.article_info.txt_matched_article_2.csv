21287568,The role of fatty acids in anti-inflammatory effects of low-intensity extremely high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.,Bioelectromagnetics,Gapeyev AB and Kulagina TP and Aripovsky AV and Chemeris NK,Missing,"The effects of low-intensity extremely high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (EHF EMR; 42.2 GHz, 0.1 mW/cm(2) , exposure duration 20 min) on the fatty acid (FA) composition of thymic cells and blood plasma in normal mice and in mice with peritoneal inflammation were studied. It was found that the exposure of normal mice to EHF EMR increased the content of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) (eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic) in thymic cells. Using a model of zymosan-induced peritoneal inflammation, it was shown that the exposure of mice to EHF EMR significantly increased the content of PUFAs (dihomo-gamma-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic) and reduced the content of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) (palmitoleic and oleic) in thymic cells. Changes in the FA composition in the blood plasma were less pronounced and manifested themselves as an increase in the level of saturated FAs during the inflammation. The data obtained support the notion that MUFAs are replaced by PUFAs that can enter into the thymic cells from the external media. Taking into account the fact that the metabolites of PUFAs are lipid messengers actively involved in inflammatory and immune reactions, we assume that the increase in the content of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in phospholipids of cellular membranes facilitates the realization of anti-inflammatory effects of EHF EMR.","Animals
