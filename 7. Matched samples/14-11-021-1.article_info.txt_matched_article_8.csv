OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the 12-item Short Form of the Medical Outcomes Study (SF-12) could yield a valid description of the health status of a large number of dermatological outpatients. METHODS: The SF-12 and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were utilized. Questionnaires were self-completed by the outpatients in the waiting rooms. At the end of the visit the dermatologists recorded the diagnosis and the evaluation of the clinical severity. RESULTS: Data were complete for 2499 patients. We observed a reduction in the Physical Component Summary score (PCS-12) with increasing age, while the Mental Component Summary score (MCS-12) was stable. PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores were worse in women. Twenty-three per cent of patients were identified as GHQ-12 positive. GHQ-12-positive patients ('cases') had lower PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores compared with GHQ-12-negative patients (mean +/- SD, PCS-12: 47.9 +/- 10.8 vs. 52.2 +/- 6.6; MCS-12: 35.2 +/- 10.2 vs. 50.9 +/- 78.3, respectively). High correlations between the MCS-12 score and the GHQ-12 were documented overall (-0.690, P < 0.001) and for single skin diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of dermatological diseases is high for the mental components of health status; the mean scores for MCS-12 were low, and lower in patients identified as GHQ-12 'cases'. The picture of the general health status of patients with skin diseases given by the SF-12 allows meaningful comparisons both within dermatological conditions and with diseases in other specialties, as well as within categories of clinical severity and psychological well-being in single skin conditions.","Adolescent
