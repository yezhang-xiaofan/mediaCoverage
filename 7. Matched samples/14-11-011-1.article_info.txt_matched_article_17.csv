21335549,Differential sensitivity of hypoxia inducible factor hydroxylation sites to hypoxia and hydroxylase inhibitors.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Tian YM and Yeoh KK and Lee MK and Eriksson T and Kessler BM and Kramer HB and Edelmann MJ and Willam C and Pugh CW and Schofield CJ and Ratcliffe PJ,Missing,"Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is regulated by dual pathways involving oxygen-dependent prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation of its alpha-subunits. Prolyl hydroxylation at two sites within a central degradation domain promotes association of HIF-alpha with the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin E3 ligase and destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Asparaginyl hydroxylation blocks the recruitment of p300/CBP co-activators to a C-terminal activation domain in HIF-alpha. These hydroxylations are catalyzed by members of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) oxygenase family. Activity of the enzymes is suppressed by hypoxia, increasing both the abundance and activity of the HIF transcriptional complex. We have used hydroxy residue-specific antibodies to compare and contrast the regulation of each site of prolyl hydroxylation (Pro(402), Pro(564)) with that of asparaginyl hydroxylation (Asn(803)) in human HIF-1alpha. Our findings reveal striking differences in the sensitivity of these hydroxylations to hypoxia and to different inhibitor types of 2-OG oxygenases. Hydroxylation at the three sites in endogenous human HIF-1alpha proteins was suppressed by hypoxia in the order Pro(402) > Pro(564) > Asn(803). In contrast to some predictions from in vitro studies, prolyl hydroxylation was substantially more sensitive than asparaginyl hydroxylation to inhibition by iron chelators and transition metal ions; studies of a range of different small molecule 2-OG analogues demonstrated the feasibility of selectively inhibiting either prolyl or asparaginyl hydroxylation within cells.","Animals
