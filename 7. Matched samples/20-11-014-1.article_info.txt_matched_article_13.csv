22064426,Tumor angiogenesis: molecular pathways and therapeutic targets.,Nature medicine,Weis SM and Cheresh DA,Missing,"As angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, controlling tumor-associated angiogenesis is a promising tactic in limiting cancer progression. The tumor microenvironment comprises numerous signaling molecules and pathways that influence the angiogenic response. Understanding how these components functionally interact as angiogenic stimuli or as repressors and how mechanisms of resistance arise is required for the identification of new therapeutic strategies. Achieving a durable and efficient antiangiogenic response will require approaches to simultaneously or sequentially target multiple aspects of the tumor microenvironment.","Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use
