21763072,Nerve growth factor selectively decreases activity-dependent conduction slowing in mechano-insensitive C-nociceptors.,Pain,Obreja O and Ringkamp M and Turnquist B and Hirth M and Forsch E and Rukwied R and Petersen M and Schmelz M,Missing,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces acute sensitization of nociceptive sensory endings and long-lasting hyperalgesia. NGF modulation of sodium channel expression might contribute to neurotrophin-induced hyperalgesia. Here, we investigated NGF-evoked changes of the activity-dependent slowing of conduction in porcine C-fibers. Animals received intradermal injections of NGF (2 mug or 8 mug) or saline in both hind limbs. Extracellular recordings from the saphenous nerves were performed 1 week later. Based on sensory thresholds and electrically induced activity-dependent slowing (ADS) of axonal conduction, C-fibers were classified as mechano-sensitive afferents, mechano-insensitive afferents, cold nociceptors, and sympathetic efferents. NGF (2 mug) increased conduction velocity in C-fibers from 1.0+/-0.05 m/s to 1.2+/-0.07 m/s. In mechano-insensitive afferents, NGF (8 mug) reduced activity-dependent slowing of conduction, from 5.3+/-0.2% to 3.2+/-0.5% (0.125-0.5 Hz stimulation) and from 28.5+/-1.3% to 20.9+/-1.9% (2 Hz stimulation), such that ADS no longer differentiated between mechano-sensitive and mechano-insensitive fibers. Accordingly, the number of fibers with pronounced ADS decreased but more units with pronounced ADS were mechano-sensitive. Spontaneously active C-fibers were increased above the control level (1%) by NGF 8 mug (8%). The results demonstrate that NGF changes the functional axonal characteristics of mechano-insensitive C-fibers and enhances spontaneous activity thereby possibly contributing to hyperalgesia.","Animals
