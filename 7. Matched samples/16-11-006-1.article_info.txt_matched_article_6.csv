21748382,68Ga-DOTA-affibody molecule for in vivo assessment of HER2/neu expression with PET.,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,Kramer-Marek G and Shenoy N and Seidel J and Griffiths GL and Choyke P and Capala J,Missing,"PURPOSE: Overexpression of HER2/neu in breast cancer is correlated with a poor prognosis. It may vary between primary tumors and metastatic lesions and change during the treatment. Therefore, there is a need for a new means to assess HER2/neu expression in vivo. In this work, we used (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-Z(HER2:2891)-Affibody to monitor HER2/neu expression in a panel of breast cancer xenografts. METHODS: DOTA-Z(HER2:2891)-Affibody molecules were labeled with (68)Ga. In vitro binding was characterized by a receptor saturation assay. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies were conducted in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous human breast cancer tumors with three different levels of HER2/neu expression. Nonspecific uptake was analyzed using non-HER2-specific Affibody molecules. Signal detected by PET was compared with ex vivo assessment of the tracer uptake and HER2/neu expression. RESULTS: The (68)Ga-DOTA-Z(HER2:2891)-Affibody probe showed high binding affinity to MDA-MB-361 cells (K (D) = 1.4 +/- 0.19 nM). In vivo biodistribution and PET imaging studies demonstrated high radioactivity uptake in HER2/neu-positive tumors. Tracer was eliminated quickly from the blood and normal tissues, resulting in high tumor-to-blood ratios. The highest concentration of radioactivity in normal tissue was seen in the kidneys (227 +/- 14%ID/g). High-contrast PET images of HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors were recorded as soon as 1 h after tracer injection. A good correlation was observed between PET imaging, biodistribution estimates of tumor tracer concentration, and the receptor expression. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PET imaging using (68)Ga-DOTA-Z(HER2:2891)-Affibody is sensitive enough to detect different levels of HER2/neu expression in vivo.","Animals
