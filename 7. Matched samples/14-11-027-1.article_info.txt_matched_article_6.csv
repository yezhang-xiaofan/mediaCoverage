21873467,Genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer: unravelling tumour biology and progressing translational oncology.,Gut,Mazur PK and Siveke JT,Missing,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a devastating disease despite tremendous scientific efforts. Numerous trials have failed to improve the outcome on this deadliest of all major cancers. Potential causes include a still insufficient understanding of key features of this cancer and imperfect preclinical models for identification of active agents and mechanisms of therapeutic responses and resistance. Modern genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC faithfully recapitulate the genetic and biological evolution of human PDAC, thereby providing a potentially powerful tool for addressing tumour biological issues as well as strategies for early detection and assessment of responses to therapeutic interventions. Here, the authors will discuss opportunities and challenges in the application of genetically engineered mouse models for translational approaches in pancreatic cancer and provide a non-exhaustive list of examples with already existing or future clinical relevance.","Animals
