We therefore examined whether targeting these pathways by a kidney-targeting Smad7 gene transfer has therapeutic effects on renal lesions in the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We delivered Smad7 plasmids into the kidney of db/db mice using kidney-targeting, ultrasound-mediated, microbubble-inducible gene transfer. The histopathology, ultrastructural pathology and pathways of TGF-beta/SMAD2/3-mediated fibrosis and NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation were evaluated. RESULTS: In this mouse model of type 2 diabetes, Smad7 gene therapy significantly inhibited diabetic kidney injury, compared with mice treated with empty vectors. Symptoms inhibited included: (1) proteinuria and renal function impairment; (2) renal fibrosis such as glomerular sclerosis, tubulo-interstitial collagen matrix abundance and renal inflammation, including Inos (also known as Nos2), Il1b and Mcp1 (also known as Ccl2) upregulation, as well as macrophage infiltration; and (3) podocyte and endothelial cell injury as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and/or electron microscopy. Further study demonstrated that the improvement of type 2 diabetic kidney injury by overexpression of Smad7 was associated with significantly inhibited local activation of the TGF-beta/SMAD and NF-kappaB signalling pathways in the kidney. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results clearly demonstrate that kidney-targeting Smad7 gene transfer may be an effective therapy for type 2 diabetic nephropathy, acting via simultaneous modulation of the TGF-beta/SMAD and NF-kappaB signalling pathways.","Animals
