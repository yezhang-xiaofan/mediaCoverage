This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors. To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo, we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [double-knockout (DKO)]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro. Moreover, DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture. This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1, indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro. Notably, we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss, with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss. Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo.","9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/toxicity
