21505188,Effects of valproate on Tax and HBZ expression in HTLV-1 and HAM/TSP T lymphocytes.,Blood,Belrose G and Gross A and Olindo S and Lezin A and Dueymes M and Komla-Soukha I and Smadja D and Tanaka Y and Willems L and Mesnard JM and Peloponese JM Jr and Cesaire R,Missing,"A determinant of human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) development is the HTLV-1-infected cell burden. Viral proteins Tax and HBZ, encoded by the sense and antisense strands of the pX region, respectively, play key roles in HTLV-1 persistence. Tax drives CD4(+)-T cell clonal expansion and is the immunodominant viral antigen recognized by the immune response. Valproate (2-n-propylpentanoic acid, VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was thought to trigger Tax expression, thereby exposing the latent HTLV-1 reservoir to immune destruction. We evaluated the impact of VPA on Tax, Gag, and HBZ expressions in cultured lymphocytes from HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP patients. Approximately one-fifth of provirus-positive CD4(+) T cells spontaneously became Tax-positive, but this fraction rose to two-thirds of Tax-positive-infected cells when cultured with VPA. Valproate enhanced Gag-p19 release. Tax- and Gag-mRNA levels peaked spontaneously, before declining concomitantly to HBZ-mRNA increase. VPA enhanced and prolonged Tax-mRNA expression, whereas it blocked HBZ expression. Our findings suggest that, in addition to modulating Tax expression, another mechanism involving HBZ repression might determine the outcome of VPA treatment on HTLV-1-infected-cell proliferation and survival.","Antisense Elements (Genetics)/drug effects
