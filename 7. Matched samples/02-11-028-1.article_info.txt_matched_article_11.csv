21836474,Transforming growth factor-beta inhibits myocardial PPARgamma expression in pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling in mice.,Journal of hypertension,Gong K and Chen YF and Li P and Lucas JA and Hage FG and Yang Q and Nozell SE and Oparil S and Xing D,Missing,"OBJECTIVES: Pharmacological activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has been shown to attenuate pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis, suggesting that PPARgamma has an antifibrotic effect. This study tested the hypothesis that there is a functional interaction between transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling and endogenous PPARgamma expression in cardiac fibroblasts and pressure overloaded heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: We observed that, in response to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction, left-ventricular PPARgamma protein levels were decreased in wild-type mice, but increased in mice with an inducible overexpression of dominant negative mutation of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (DnTGFbetaRII), in which TGF-beta signaling is blocked. In isolated mouse cardiac fibroblasts, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 treatment decreased steady state PPARgamma mRNA (-34%) and protein (-52%) levels, as well as PPARgamma transcriptional activity (-53%). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TGF-beta1 treatment increased binding of Smad2/3, Smad4 and histone deacetylase 1, and decreased binding of acetylated histone 3 to the PPARgamma promoter in cardiac fibroblasts. Both pharmacological activation and overexpression of PPARgamma significantly inhibited TGF-beta1-induced extracellular matrix molecule expression in isolated cardiac fibroblasts, whereas treatment with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone inhibited, and treatment with the PPARgamma antagonist T0070907 exacerbated chronic pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling in wild-type mice in vivo. CONCLUSION: These data provide strong evidence that TGF-beta1 directly suppresses PPARgamma expression in cardiac fibroblasts via a transcriptional mechanism and suggest that the down-regulation of endogenous PPARgamma expression by TGF-beta may be involved in pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis.","Animals
