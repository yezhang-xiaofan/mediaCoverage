21288940,Ploidy and the evolution of parasitism.,Proceedings. Biological sciences / The Royal Society,M'Gonigle LK and Otto SP,Missing,"Levels of parasitism are continuously distributed in nature. Models of host-parasite coevolution, however, typically assume that species can be easily characterized as either parasitic or non-parasitic. Consequently, it is poorly understood which factors influence the evolution of parasitism itself. We investigate how ploidy level and the genetic mechanisms underlying infection influence evolution along the continuum of parasitism levels. In order for parasitism to evolve, selective benefits to the successful invasion of hosts must outweigh the losses when encountering resistant hosts. However, we find that exactly where this threshold occurs depends not only on the strength of selection, but also on the genetic model of interaction, the ploidy level in each species, and the nature of the costs to virulence and resistance. With computer simulations, we are able to incorporate more realistic dynamics at the loci underlying species interactions and to extend our analyses in a number of directions, including finite population sizes, multiple alleles and different generation times.","Animals
