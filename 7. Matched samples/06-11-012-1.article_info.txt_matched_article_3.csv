The study objective was to demonstrate the prognostic utility of the combined index in early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: In a blinded retrospective analysis of 588 ER-positive tamoxifen-treated and untreated breast cancer patients from the randomised prospective Stockholm trial, H:I and MGI were measured using real-time RT-PCR. Association with patient outcome was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression. A continuous risk index was developed using Cox modelling. RESULTS: The dichotomous H:I+MGI was significantly associated with distant recurrence and breast cancer death. The >50% of tamoxifen-treated patients categorised as low-risk had <3% 10-year distant recurrence risk. A continuous risk model (Breast Cancer Index (BCI)) was developed with the tamoxifen-treated group and the prognostic performance tested in the untreated group was 53% of patients categorised as low risk with an 8.3% 10-year distant recurrence risk. CONCLUSION: Retrospective analysis of this randomised, prospective trial cohort validated the prognostic utility of H:I+MGI and was used to develop and test a continuous risk model that enables prediction of distant recurrence risk at the patient level.","Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology
