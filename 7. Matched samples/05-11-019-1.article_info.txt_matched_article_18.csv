21641397,Extracellular superoxide dismutase in macrophages augments bacterial killing by promoting phagocytosis.,The American journal of pathology,Manni ML and Tomai LP and Norris CA and Thomas LM and Kelley EE and Salter RD and Crapo JD and Chang LY and Watkins SC and Piganelli JD and Oury TD,Missing,"Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is abundant in the lung and limits inflammation and injury in response to many pulmonary insults. To test the hypothesis that EC-SOD has an important role in bacterial infections, wild-type and EC-SOD knockout (KO) mice were infected with Escherichia coli to induce pneumonia. Although mice in the EC-SOD KO group demonstrated greater pulmonary inflammation than did wild-type mice, there was less clearance of bacteria from their lungs after infection. Macrophages and neutrophils express EC-SOD; however, its function and subcellular localization in these inflammatory cells is unclear. In the present study, immunogold electron microscopy revealed EC-SOD in membrane-bound vesicles of phagocytes. These findings suggest that inflammatory cell EC-SOD may have a role in antibacterial defense. To test this hypothesis, phagocytes from wild-type and EC-SOD KO mice were evaluated. Although macrophages lacking EC-SOD produced more reactive oxygen species than did cells expressing EC-SOD after stimulation, they demonstrated significantly impaired phagocytosis and killing of bacteria. Overall, this suggests that EC-SOD facilitates clearance of bacteria and limits inflammation in response to infection by promoting bacterial phagocytosis.","Animals
