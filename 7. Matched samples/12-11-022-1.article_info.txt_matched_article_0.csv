The paradigm of GPCR signalling is the activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (G protein) by an agonist-occupied receptor. The beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) activation of Gs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, has long been a model system for GPCR signalling. Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric beta(2)AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the beta(2)AR and Gs involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal alpha-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the beta(2)AR include a 14 A outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an alpha-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the alpha-helical domain of Galphas relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR.","Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists/chemistry/metabolism
