The size and linkage of a ubiquitin chain, which determines whether a substrate is efficiently targeted for proteasomal degradation, is determined by the interplay between ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation. A conserved factor that orchestrates distinct substrate-processing co-regulators in diverse species is the ubiquitin-selective chaperone CDC-48 (also known as p97). Several deubiquitylation enzymes (DUBs) have been shown to interact with CDC-48/p97, but the mechanistic and physiological relevance of these interactions remained elusive. Here we report a synergistic cooperation between CDC-48 and ATX-3 (the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of ataxin-3) in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and ageing regulation. Surprisingly, worms deficient for both cdc-48.1 and atx-3 demonstrated extended lifespan by up to 50%, mediated through the insulin-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signalling pathway. As lifespan extension specifically depends on the deubiquitylation activity of ATX-3, our findings identify a mechanistic link between protein degradation and longevity through editing of the ubiquitylation status of substrates involved in insulin-IGF-1 signalling.","Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism
