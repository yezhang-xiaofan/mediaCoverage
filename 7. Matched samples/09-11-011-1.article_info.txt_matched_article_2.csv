21769492,The association between antihypertensive drug use and incidence of prostate cancer in Finland: a population-based case-control study.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Kemppainen KJ and Tammela TL and Auvinen A and Murtola TJ,Missing,"Some studies have suggested that use of antihypertensive drugs could decrease prostate cancer risk. We evaluated this association at the population level. All prostate cancer cases in Finland during 1995-2002 and matched controls (24,657 case-control pairs) were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the Population Register Center, respectively. Detailed information on antihypertensive drug purchases was obtained from a national prescription database. Data were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression model. Ever use of antihypertensive drugs was associated with marginally elevated overall prostate cancer risk (OR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21). Risk of advanced prostate cancer did not differ from the nonusers (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98-1.18). The risk increase was observed constantly in all classes of antihypertensive drugs. Our large population-based study generally does not support decreased risk of prostate cancer among antihypertensive drug users. Conversely, an increased overall prostate cancer risk was observed. The association being similar for all drug groups suggests that it is probably caused by a systematic difference between medication users and nonusers, such as differing PSA testing activity.","Antihypertensive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects
