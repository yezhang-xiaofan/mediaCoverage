22383145,Conflict of interest policies and disclosure requirements among European Society of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Journals.,European heart journal,Alfonso F and Timmis A and Pinto FJ and Ambrosio G and Ector H and Kulakowski P and Vardas P,Missing,"Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (COIs) is used by biomedical journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process. Conflict of interest disclosure, however, is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals. Recent joint editorial efforts paved the way towards the implementation of uniform vehicles for COI disclosure. This paper provides a comprehensive editorial perspective on classical COI-related issues. New insights into the current COI policies and practices among European Society of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Journals, as derived from a cross-sectional survey using a standardized questionnaire, are discussed.","Authorship/*standards
