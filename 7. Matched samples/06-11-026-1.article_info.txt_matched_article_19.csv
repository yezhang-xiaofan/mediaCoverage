22070203,Effects of heat and ultraviolet radiation on the oxidative stability of pine nut oil supplemented with carnosic acid.,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Wang H and Zu G and Yang L and Zu YG and Wang H and Zhang ZH and Zhang Y and Zhang L and Wang HZ,Missing,"The effects of carnosic acid (CA) of different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/g) and two common antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene and alpha-tocopherol) on oxidative stability in pine nut oil at different accelerated conditions (heating and ultraviolet radiation) were compared. The investigation focused on the increase in peroxide and conjugated diene values, as well as free fatty acid and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The changes in trans fatty acid and aldehyde compound contents were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while the changes in pinolenic acid content were monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that CA was more effective in restraining pine nut oil oxidation under heating, UV-A and UV-B radiation, in which a dose-response relationship was observed. The antioxidant activity of CA was stronger than that of alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Pine nut oil supplemented with 0.2 mg/g CA exhibited favorable antioxidant effects and is preferable for effectively avoiding oxidation.","Antioxidants/*administration & dosage
