21956424,Association of glucocorticoid use and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): 2001-2006.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Skversky AL and Kumar J and Abramowitz MK and Kaskel FJ and Melamed ML,Missing,"CONTEXT: In many disorders requiring steroid therapy, there is substantial decrease in bone mineral density. The association between steroid use and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency has not been confirmed in large population-based studies, and currently there are no specific vitamin D recommendations for steroid users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of serum 25(OH)D deficiency [defined as 25(OH)D <10 ng/ml] with oral steroid use. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis was performed using NHANES 2001-2006. SETTING: We analyzed a nationally representative sample of U.S. children and adults. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of children, adolescents, and adults from NHANES 2001-2006 (n = 22,650), representative of 286 million U.S. residents, with serum 25(OH)D levels and data on other potential confounders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We measured serum 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml. RESULTS: A total of 181 individuals (0.9% of the population) used steroids within the past 30 d. Overall, 5% of the population had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml. Among steroid users, 11% had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml, compared to 5% among steroid nonusers (P = 0.009). The odds of having 25(OH)D deficiency were 2-fold higher in those who reported steroid use compared to those without steroid use [odds ratio (OR), 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25, 4.45]. This association remained after multivariable adjustment (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.01, 4.85) and in a multivariable model using NHANES III data (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.01, 3.48). CONCLUSION: Steroid use is independently associated with 25(OH)D deficiency in this nationally representative cohort limited by cross-sectional data. It suggests the need for screening and repletion in patients on chronic steroids.","Adolescent
