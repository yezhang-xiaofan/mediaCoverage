We hypothesised that metabolomic profiling would identify biomarkers predicting changes in IR with weight loss. METHODS: Targeted mass spectrometry-based profiling of 60 metabolites, plus biochemical assays of NEFA, beta-hydroxybutyrate, ketones, insulin and glucose were performed in baseline and 6 month plasma samples from 500 participants who had lost >/=4 kg during Phase I of the Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM) trial. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and change in HOMA-IR with weight loss (HOMA-IR) were calculated. Principal components analysis (PCA) and mixed models adjusted for race, sex, baseline weight, and amount of weight loss were used; findings were validated in an independent cohort of patients (n = 22). RESULTS: Mean weight loss was 8.67 +/- 4.28 kg; mean HOMA-IR was -0.80 +/- 1.73, range -28.9 to 4.82). Baseline PCA-derived factor 3 (branched chain amino acids [BCAAs] and associated catabolites) correlated with baseline HOMA-IR (r = 0.50, p < 0.0001) and independently associated with HOMA-IR (p < 0.0001). HOMA-IR increased in a linear fashion with increasing baseline factor 3 quartiles. Amount of weight loss was only modestly correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.24). These findings were validated in the independent cohort, with a factor composed of BCAAs and related metabolites predicting HOMA-IR (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A cluster of metabolites comprising BCAAs and related analytes predicts improvement in HOMA-IR independent of the amount of weight lost. These results may help identify individuals most likely to benefit from moderate weight loss and elucidate novel mechanisms of IR in obesity.","Adult
