METHODS: We used diagnosis codes on data collection forms from the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) to identify kernicterus cases among children born from 1988 to 1997. We examined kernicterus mortality trends in the United States from 1979 to 2006 using death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics. RESULTS: We identified 25 cases of physician-diagnosed kernicterus. This figure was augmented to reflect estimates of cases lost to infant mortality, yielding incidence estimates of 1 in 200 000 California live births, 1 in 2500 among children who received services from DDS, and 1 in 400 children with cerebral palsy. There was no significant trend in kernicterus incidence from 1988 to 1997 (P = .77). Incidence before and after the 1994 publication of the AAP practice parameter for hyperbilirubinemia in healthy term infants was not significantly different (P = .92). Nationally, there were 3 reported infant deaths from kernicterus in 1994 and 2 or fewer in the other 28 years from 1979 to 2006 (0.28 deaths per million live births): there was no significant increase in kernicterus mortality over this period. CONCLUSION: Data from California do not support a resurgence of kernicterus in the 1990s. Deaths from kernicterus in the United States have remained rare, with no apparent increase during the last 25 years.","Adolescent
