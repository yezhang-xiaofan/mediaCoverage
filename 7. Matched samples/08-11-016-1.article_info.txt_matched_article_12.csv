21549339,A mutation in the Golgi Qb-SNARE gene GOSR2 causes progressive myoclonus epilepsy with early ataxia.,American journal of human genetics,Corbett MA and Schwake M and Bahlo M and Dibbens LM and Lin M and Gandolfo LC and Vears DF and O'Sullivan JD and Robertson T and Bayly MA and Gardner AE and Vlaar AM and Korenke GC and Bloem BR and de Coo IF and Verhagen JM and Lehesjoki AE and Gecz J and Berkovic SF,Missing,"The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of predominantly recessive disorders that present with action myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, and progressive neurological decline. Many PMEs have similar clinical presentations yet are genetically heterogeneous, making accurate diagnosis difficult. A locus for PME was mapped in a consanguineous family with a single affected individual to chromosome 17q21. An identical-by-descent, homozygous mutation in GOSR2 (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp), a Golgi vesicle transport gene, was identified in this patient and in four apparently unrelated individuals. A comparison of the phenotypes in these patients defined a clinically distinct PME syndrome characterized by early-onset ataxia, action myoclonus by age 6, scoliosis, and mildly elevated serum creatine kinase. This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi.","Amino Acid Sequence
