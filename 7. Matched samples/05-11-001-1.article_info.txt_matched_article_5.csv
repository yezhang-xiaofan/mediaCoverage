21224078,The dynamics of macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall during atherosclerotic lesion development in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice.,The American journal of pathology,Ye D and Zhao Y and Hildebrand RB and Singaraja RR and Hayden MR and Van Berkel TJ and Van Eck M,leidenuniv,"Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease in which macrophages play an essential role. Macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall induces the development of an early atherosclerotic lesion. However, the dynamics of macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall during lesion progression remain poorly understood. In this study, low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice were fed a Western-type diet for 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks to induce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions with different degrees of complexity. Subsequently, these mice underwent transplantation with bone marrow-overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein to track donor-derived cells, including macrophages. After 8 weeks of Western-type diet feeding after transplantation, macrophage infiltration was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of donor-derived macrophages (enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive F4/80(+)) in the aortic roots. We found that the growth of pre-existing initial lesions was mainly caused by continued recruitment of donor-derived macrophages into the arterial wall. Interestingly, macrophage infiltration into pre-existing more advanced lesions was largely impaired, likely because of the formation of fibrous caps. In addition, interference with the expression of macrophage ATP-binding cassette transporter 1, an ATP-binding cassette transporter involved in cellular cholesterol efflux and macrophage recruitment into tissues, affects the infiltration of macrophages into pre-existing early lesions but not into advanced lesions. In conclusion, our data suggest that the dynamics of macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall vary greatly during atherogenesis and, thus, may affect the efficiency of pharmaceutical interventions aimed at targeting macrophage infiltration into the arterial wall.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1
