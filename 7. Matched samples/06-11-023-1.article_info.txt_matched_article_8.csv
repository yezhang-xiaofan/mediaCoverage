We examined the effects of exenatide on FGF21 in patients with type 2 diabetes and in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity (DIO). METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n = 24) on diet and/or metformin were randomised (using a table of random numbers) to receive additional treatment consisting of pioglitazone 45 mg/day or combined therapy with pioglitazone (45 mg/day) and exenatide (10 mug twice daily) for 12 months in an open label parallel study at the Baylor Clinic. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the entire study and were included in the analysis. Pioglitazone treatment (n = 10) reduced hepatic fat as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, despite a significant increase in body weight (Delta = 3.7 kg); plasma FGF21 levels did not change (1.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 ng/ml [mean +/- SEM]). However, combined pioglitazone and exenatide therapy (n = 11) was associated with a significant reduction of FGF21 levels (2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) and a greater decrease in hepatic fat. Besides weight gain observed in the pioglitazone-treated patients, lower extremity oedema was observed as a side effect in two of the ten patients. Three patients who received pioglitazone and exenatide combination therapy complained of significant nausea that was self-limiting and did not require them to leave the study. In DIO mice, exendin-4 for 4 weeks significantly reduced hepatic triacylglycerol content, decreased hepatic FGF21 protein and mRNA, and enhanced phosphorylation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, although no significant difference in weight and body fat was observed. Hepatic FGF21 correlated inversely with hepatic AMPK phosphorylation CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 diabetes mellitus, combined pioglitazone and exenatide therapy is associated with a reduction in plasma FGF21 levels, as well as a greater decrease in hepatic fat than that achieved with pioglitazone therapy. In DIO mice, exendin-4 treatment reduces hepatic triacylglycerol and FGF21 protein, and enhances hepatic AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting an improvement of hepatic FGF21 resistance.
