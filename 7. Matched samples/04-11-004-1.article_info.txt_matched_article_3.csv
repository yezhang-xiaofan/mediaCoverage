21030454,Exposure to combustion of solid fuel and tuberculosis: a matched case-control study.,The European respiratory journal,Gninafon M and Ade G and Ait-Khaled N and Enarson DA and Chiang CY,Missing,"The present study was conducted in Benin to ascertain the association between exposure to combustion of solid fuel (coal and biomass) and tuberculosis. Cases were consecutive, sputum smear-positive tuberculosis patients never previously treated for tuberculosis for as long as 1 month. Two controls were selected from the neighbourhood of each case, matched by age and sex by a predefined procedure. A total of 200 new smear-positive cases and 400 neighbourhood controls were enrolled. In univariate analysis, using solid fuel for cooking (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8), ever smoking (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.1-9.8), male sex (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.6-71.1), daily use of alcoholic beverages (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and having a family member with tuberculosis in the previous 5 yrs (OR 30.5, 95% CI 10.8-85.8) were all significantly associated with tuberculosis cases. When all significant variables were entered into a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the association between using solid fuel for cooking and tuberculosis cases was no longer statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.7). In conclusion, the association between exposure to combustion of solid fuel and tuberculosis was relatively weak and not statistically significant.","Adult
