21881832,Exploring the role of soluble factors associated with immune regulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells.,Stem cell reviews,Bassi EJ and de Almeida DC and Moraes-Vieira PM and Camara NO,Missing,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are characterized as multipotent stromal cells with the capacity for both self-renewal and differentiation into mesodermal cell lineages. MSCs also have a fibroblast-like phenotype and can be isolated from several tissues. In recent years, researchers have found that MSCs secrete several soluble factors that exert immunosuppressive effects by modulating both innate (macrophages, dendritic and NK cells) and adaptive (B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) immune responses. This review summarizes the principal trophic factors that are related to immune regulation and secreted by MSCs under both autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The understanding of mechanisms that regulate immunity in MSCs field is important for their future use as a novel cellular-based immunotherapy with clinical applications in several diseases.","Animals
