21285983,"PG545, a dual heparanase and angiogenesis inhibitor, induces potent anti-tumour and anti-metastatic efficacy in preclinical models.",British journal of cancer,Dredge K and Hammond E and Handley P and Gonda TJ and Smith MT and Vincent C and Brandt R and Ferro V and Bytheway I,Missing,"BACKGROUND: PG545 is a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic that inhibits tumour angiogenesis by sequestering angiogenic growth factors in the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus limiting subsequent binding to receptors. Importantly, PG545 also inhibits heparanase, the only endoglycosidase which cleaves HS chains in the ECM. The aim of the study was to assess PG545 in various solid tumour and metastasis models. METHODS: The anti-angiogenic, anti-tumour and anti-metastatic properties of PG545 were assessed using in vivo angiogenesis, solid tumour and metastasis models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were also generated in tumour-bearing mice to gain an understanding of optimal dosing schedules and regimens. RESULTS: PG545 was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and induce anti-tumour or anti-metastatic effects in murine models of breast, prostate, liver, lung, colon, head and neck cancers and melanoma. Enhanced anti-tumour activity was also noted when used in combination with sorafenib in a liver cancer model. PK data revealed that the half-life of PG545 was relatively long, with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of radiolabeled PG545 observed in liver tumours. CONCLUSION: PG545 is a new anti-angiogenic clinical candidate for cancer therapy. The anti-metastatic property of PG545, likely due to the inhibition of heparanase, may prove to be a critical attribute as the compound enters phase I clinical trials.","Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use
