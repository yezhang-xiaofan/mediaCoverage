OBJECTIVE: To assess the test performance of two newborn screening strategies for CF. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2008 and 2009, CF screening was added to the routine screening programme as a prospective study in part of The Netherlands. INTERVENTIONS: Two strategies were performed in all newborns. In the first strategy, concentrations of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) were measured. In the second method, samples with IRT >/=60 mug/litre were analysed for 36 CFTR mutations, followed by sequencing when a single mutation was detected. Tests were positive only with two identified CFTR mutations. MAIN OUTCOME: Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of both screening strategies. RESULTS: 145,499 infants were screened. The IRT/PAP approach showed a sensitivity of 95.0%, a specificity of 99.897% and a PPV of 12.3%. Test properties for the IRT/DNA/sequencing strategy were respectively 100%, 100% and 64.9%. Combining both strategies (IRT/PAP/DNA/sequencing) led to a sensitivity of 95.0%, a specificity of 100% and a PPV of 87.5%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, all strategies performed well. Although there was no statistically significant difference in test performance, the IRT/DNA/sequencing strategy detected one infant that was missed by IRT/PAP (/DNA/sequencing). IRT/PAP may be the optimal choice if the use of DNA technology must be avoided. If identification of carriers and equivocal diagnosis is considered an important disadvantage, IRT/PAP/DNA/sequencing may be the best choice.","Antigens, Neoplasm/*diagnostic use
