In this study, we examined the relationship between mesenteric fat thickness and other sonographic indices of adiposity and the presence of fatty liver among subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 117 Chinese subjects with PCOS were evaluated (mean age, 28.6 +/- 6.5 yr; mean body mass index, 24.3 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2)). Anthropometric measurements and metabolic risk profile, including a standard oral glucose tolerance test, were assessed in all subjects. All subjects underwent an ultrasound examination for measurement of thickness of mesenteric, preperitoneal, and sc fat as well as evaluation for fatty liver. RESULTS: Forty-six (39.3%) of the subjects had fatty liver. PCOS subjects with fatty liver had higher body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and systolic blood pressure; a more unfavorable lipid profile with higher triglyceride; lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; higher fasting glucose and insulin; higher 2-h glucose during oral glucose tolerance test; lower SHBG; and higher alanine aminotransferase. Subjects with fatty liver had increased thickness of preperitoneal, mesenteric, and sc fat, as well as increased carotid intima-media thickness. Abdominal fat thickness showed moderate correlation to alanine aminotransferase as well as fasting insulin. On multivariate logistic regression, fasting insulin and mesenteric fat thickness were identified as independent predictors of fatty liver among subjects with PCOS. CONCLUSION: Fatty liver is present in a significant proportion of Chinese patients with PCOS. Sonographic measurement of mesenteric fat is an independent determinant of fatty liver among subjects with PCOS and identifies subjects at increased cardiovascular risk.","Adipose Tissue/*ultrasonography
