21382548,Cytoplasmic intron sequence-retaining transcripts can be dendritically targeted via ID element retrotransposons.,Neuron,Buckley PT and Lee MT and Sul JY and Miyashiro KY and Bell TJ and Fisher SA and Kim J and Eberwine J,Missing,"RNA precursors give rise to mRNA after splicing of intronic sequences traditionally thought to occur in the nucleus. Here, we show that intron sequences are retained in a number of dendritically-targeted mRNAs, by using microarray and Illumina sequencing of isolated dendritic mRNA as well as in situ hybridization. Many of the retained introns contain ID elements, a class of SINE retrotransposon. A portion of these SINEs confers dendritic targeting to exogenous and endogenous transcripts showing the necessity of ID-mediated mechanisms for the targeting of different transcripts to dendrites. ID elements are capable of selectively altering the distribution of endogenous proteins, providing a link between intronic SINEs and protein function. As such, the ID element represents a common dendritic targeting element found across multiple RNAs. Retention of intronic sequence is a more general phenomenon than previously thought and plays a functional role in the biology of the neuron, partly mediated by co-opted repetitive sequences.","Animals
