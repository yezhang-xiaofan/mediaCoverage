22213739,Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin drug resistance: retrospective analysis of a national U.K. molecular service over the last decade.,Thorax,Seoudi N and Mitchell SL and Brown TJ and Dashti F and Amin AK and Drobniewski FA,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Fast and reliable detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and drug resistance is crucial in establishing effective treatment and enforcing timely public health measures. METHODS: The authors analysed the performance of a national U.K. molecular diagnostic service over a decade, based on the use of a line probe assay (Innolipa, LiPA) compared with conventional liquid and solid cultures with rapid molecular identification and culture-based drug resistance testing. FINDINGS: Data were available for 7836 consecutive patient samples using LiPA and the reference microbiological technique (conventional liquid and solid cultures with rapid molecular identification and culture-based drug resistance testing). For all sputum specimens (n=3382) the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for MTBC detection were 93.4%, 85.6%, 92.7%, 86.9% and 90.7%; the equivalent values for smear-positive sputum specimens (n=2606) were 94.7%, 80.9%, 93.9%, 83.3% and 91.3%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for detection of rifampicin resistance in all sputum samples (n=1667) were 92.1%, 99.3%, 89.4%, 99.5% and 98.9%, respectively; the equivalent values for smear-positive sputum specimens (n=1477) were 93.3%, 99.3%, 87.5%, 99.6% and 99%. Between January 2006 and December 2008, LiPA saved 25.3 and 32.2 days for TB diagnosis and rifampicin resistance of smear-positive samples, respectively. INTERPRETATION: A molecular diagnostic service, using a non-automated line probe assay approach, provides a rapid and reliable national service for diagnosing MTBC and rifampicin resistance.","Antibiotics, Antitubercular/*pharmacology
