22265699,Lithium toxicity profile: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Lancet,McKnight RF and Adida M and Budge K and Stockton S and Goodwin GM and Geddes JR,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Lithium is a widely used and effective treatment for mood disorders. There has been concern about its safety but no adequate synthesis of the evidence for adverse effects. We aimed to undertake a clinically informative, systematic toxicity profile of lithium. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. We searched electronic databases, specialist journals, reference lists, textbooks, and conference abstracts. We used a hierarchy of evidence which considered randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports that included patients with mood disorders given lithium. Outcome measures were renal, thyroid, and parathyroid function; weight change; skin disorders; hair disorders; and teratogenicity. FINDINGS: We screened 5988 abstracts for eligibility and included 385 studies in the analysis. On average, glomerular filtration rate was reduced by -6.22 mL/min (95% CI -14.65 to 2.20, p=0.148) and urinary concentrating ability by 15% of normal maximum (weighted mean difference -158.43 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -229.78 to -87.07, p<0.0001). Lithium might increase risk of renal failure, but the absolute risk was small (18 of 3369 [0.5%] patients received renal replacement therapy). The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was increased in patients taking lithium compared with those given placebo (odds ratio [OR] 5.78, 95% CI 2.00-16.67; p=0.001), and thyroid stimulating hormone was increased on average by 4.00 iU/mL (95% CI 3.90-4.10, p<0.0001). Lithium treatment was associated with increased blood calcium (+0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.02-0.17, p=0.009), and parathyroid hormone (+7.32 pg/mL, 3.42-11.23, p<0.0001). Patients receiving lithium gained more weight than did those receiving placebo (OR 1.89, 1.27-2.82, p=0.002), but not those receiving olanzapine (0.32, 0.21-0.49, p<0.0001). We recorded no significant increased risk of congenital malformations, alopecia, or skin disorders. INTERPRETATION: Lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. There is little evidence for a clinically significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low. The risk of congenital malformations is uncertain; the balance of risks should be considered before lithium is withdrawn during pregnancy. Because of the consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, calcium concentrations should be checked before and during treatment.
