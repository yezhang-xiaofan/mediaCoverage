However, it would be extremely helpful to be able to characterize the pathophysiological effects of mutations and to screen drugs in cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish as a proof of principle the disease-specific cardiomyocytes from a mouse model with LQTS 3 by use of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and to demonstrate that the mutant cardiomyocytes display the characteristic pathophysiological features in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated disease-specific iPS cells from a mouse model with a human mutation of the cardiac Na(+) channel that causes LQTS 3. The control and LQTS 3-specific iPS cell lines were pluripotent and could be differentiated into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. Patch-clamp measurements of LQTS 3-specific cardiomyocytes showed the biophysical effects of the mutation on the Na(+) current, with faster recovery from inactivation and larger late currents than observed in controls. Moreover, LQTS 3-specific cardiomyocytes had prolonged action potential durations and early afterdepolarizations at low pacing rates, both of which are classic features of the LQTS 3 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that disease-specific iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes from an LQTS 3 mouse model with a human mutation recapitulate the typical pathophysiological phenotype in vitro. Thus, this method is a powerful tool to investigate disease mechanisms in vitro and to perform patient-specific drug screening.","Animals
