21799444,"The relationship between renal impairment and left ventricular structure, function, and ventricular-arterial interaction in hypertension.",Journal of hypertension,Shah AM and Lam CS and Cheng S and Verma A and Desai AS and Rocha RA and Hilkert R and Izzo J and Oparil S and Pitt B and Thomas JD and Zile MR and Aurigemma GP and Solomon SD,harvard,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to define the relationship between renal dysfunction--both albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)--and cardiac structure and diastolic dysfunction among patients with chronic hypertension. METHODS: Both albuminuria and eGFR were measured in 540 asymptomatic patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction assessed by reduced early mitral annular relaxation velocity (E'). The majority of patients were white, mean age was 60 +/- 10 years, mean SBP was 149 +/- 18 mmHg, and there was a low prevalence comorbid conditions. Albuminuria was undetectable in 148 (27%), within the normal to low range [urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 1-25 mg/g for men, 1-17 mg/g for women] in 292 (54%), and high or very high (UACR >25 mg/g for men, >17 mg/g for women) in 100 (19%). Estimated GFR was 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or less in 75 (14%), 61-90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in 244 (45%), and more than 90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in 221 (41%). RESULTS: Albuminuria, even within the normal range, was associated with greater left ventricular wall thickness (P = 0.01), higher relative wall thickness (P = 0.004), worse diastolic function reflected in lower E' (P = 0.01), greater arterial and left ventricular end-systolic stiffness (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively), and higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level (P = 0.0025), even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics. In contrast, no independent relationship was observed between eGFR and parameters of cardiac structure or function. CONCLUSION: Among asymptomatic hypertensive patients with evidence of diastolic dysfunction, the presence of albuminuria, even within the normal range, is associated with greater concentric remodeling, greater left ventricular end-systolic stiffness, and worse diastolic function.","Aged
