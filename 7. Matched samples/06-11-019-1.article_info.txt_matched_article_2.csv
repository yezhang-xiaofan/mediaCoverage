21852449,Known risk factors for violence predict 12-month-old infants' aggressiveness with peers.,Psychological science,Hay DF and Mundy L and Roberts S and Carta R and Waters CS and Perra O and Jones R and Jones I and Goodyer I and Harold G and Thapar A and van Goozen S,Missing,"This study tested the hypothesis that 12-month-old infants' use of force against peers is associated with known risk factors for violence. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study, which included laboratory observations of firstborn British infants (N = 271) during simulated birthday parties. No gender differences in aggressiveness were observed. The infants' observed aggressiveness was significantly correlated with mothers' mood disorder during pregnancy and with mothers' history of conduct problems. Infants' observed aggressiveness was correlated with parents' ratings of infants' anger and aggression, which were also predicted by mothers' mood disorder and history of conduct problems. Our findings indicate that infants at risk for serious aggression can already be identified when the motor ability to use physical force first enters the human repertoire.","Aggression/*psychology
