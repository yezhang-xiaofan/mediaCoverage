21694452,Amyloid-beta protein precursor family members: a review from homology to biological function.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Huang HC and Jiang ZF,Missing,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disease. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the most crucial molecule related to the pathological development of AD. Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is one of AbetaPP family members with conserved type I transmembrane. The genetic mutations of AbetaPP and the abnormity of its post-transcription and proteolytic processing contribute to the elevation of Abeta. The accumulation of Abeta in senile plaques is believed to be the most important event in AD pathology. Therefore, as a key upstream molecule of Abeta, AbetaPP is related to the AD pathology, but the biological function of AbetaPP is still not fully clear. AbetaPP-like proteins are widely expressed in multicellular eukaryotes. AbetaPP-like homologous genes and proteins are highly conserved in various organisms from invertebrates to mammals. AbetaPP-like genes undergo similarly pathways of transcription and post-transcription processing, and AbetaPP-like proteins is proteolyzed by the similar alpha-cleavage and the beta-cleavage pathways. Based on the homology and the resemble domains, AbetaPP may play similar roles in organisms. In this article, we reviewed homology and structures of AbetaPP family members in organisms and further discussed potential biological function in normal and AD brains.","Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism
