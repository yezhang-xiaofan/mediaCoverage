21757729,Decoding functional metabolomics with docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) identifies novel bioactive signals.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Yang R and Fredman G and Krishnamoorthy S and Agrawal N and Irimia D and Piomelli D and Serhan CN,Missing,"Neuroinflammation and traumatic brain injury involve activation of inflammatory cells and production of local pro-inflammatory mediators that can amplify tissue damage. Using LC-UV-MS-MS-based lipidomics in tandem with functional screening at the single-cell level in microfluidic chambers, we identified a series of novel bioactive oxygenated docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide- (DHEA) derived products that regulated leukocyte motility. These included 10,17-dihydroxydocosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (10,17-diHDHEA) and 15-hydroxy-16(17)-epoxy-docosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (15-HEDPEA), each of which was an agonist of recombinant CB2 receptors with EC(50) 3.9 x 10(-10) and 1.0 x 10(-10) M. In human whole blood, 10,17-diHDHEA and 15-HEDPEA at concentrations as low as 10 pM each prevented formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates involving either platelet-monocyte or platelet-polymorphonuclear leukocyte. In vivo, 15-HEDPEA was organ-protective in mouse reperfusion second organ injury. Together these results indicate that DHEA oxidative metabolism produces potent novel molecules with anti-inflammatory and organ-protective properties.","Amides
