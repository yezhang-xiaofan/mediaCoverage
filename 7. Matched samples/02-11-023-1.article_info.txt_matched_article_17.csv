21527295,Effects of red wine on the electrical activity and functional coupling between prefrontal-parietal cortices in young men.,Appetite,Sanz-Martin A and Guevara MA and Amezcua C and Santana G and Hernandez-Gonzalez M,Missing,"The effects of low-dose red wine on cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) and the functional coupling between the frontal and parietal cortices during the first minutes after ingestion were studied. In a first experiment, 38 male volunteers participated in a wine/water challenge protocol in which each subject served as his own control. Wine-induced EEG changes appeared immediately after ingestion and continued for 40 min. These changes were characterized by an increase in the absolute power (AP) and relative power (RP) of fast frequencies (alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2), a decrease of low frequencies (delta and theta) and a specific decrease in the degree of coupling between cortices at 20 min after wine ingestion. To determine if EEG changes were produced by the alcohol in the red wine, in a second experiment, 24 male volunteers participated in an independent wine/placebo group protocol. At 20 min post-ingestion, the red wine group showed higher power in the alpha band, lower RP of low frequencies and decreased correlation, as compared to the placebo group. These findings show that low-dose red wine produces a rapid cortical activation and decreased synchronization between the prefrontal and parietal areas, which could be associated with aroused states or altered cognitive processes, as has been described in other studies.","Adolescent
