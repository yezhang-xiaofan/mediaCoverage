22387529,Insulin resistance and response to telaprevir plus peginterferon alpha and ribavirin in treatment-naive patients infected with HCV genotype 1.,Gut,Serfaty L and Forns X and Goeser T and Ferenci P and Nevens F and Carosi G and Drenth JP and Lonjon-Domanec I and DeMasi R and Picchio G and Beumont M and Marcellin P,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance is a predictor of poor response to peginterferon/ribavirin in patients infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). There are no data on direct-acting antivirals. This exploratory analysis assessed the effect of metabolic factors and insulin resistance, measured by homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA), on virological response to telaprevir in Study C208. DESIGN: Overall, 161 HCV genotype 1-infected, treatment-naive patients received 12 weeks of telaprevir plus peginterferon/ribavirin, then 12/36 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin depending on on-treatment response criteria. The prognostic significance of several factors, including HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), on virological response at weeks 4 and 12, end of treatment and 24 weeks after treatment was explored by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Baseline HOMA-IR data were available for 147 patients; baseline characteristics were consistent with the overall population. Baseline HOMA-IR <2, 2-4 and >4 was seen in 54%, 30% and 16% of patients, respectively. Neither response rates (any time point) nor week 4 viral load decline were significantly influenced by baseline HOMA-IR. In multivariate analyses, fibrosis stage and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were predictive of sustained virological response (OR 0.47 and 1.02, respectively). After the end of treatment, HOMA-IR was significantly lower in patients with sustained virological response than in those without (0.61 vs 1.34 for relapsers and 1.15 for non-responders; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In this study, baseline HOMA-IR was not predictive of virological response to telaprevir in HCV genotype 1-infected, treatment-naive patients, while sustained virological response was associated with improved HOMA-IR. These results suggest that metabolic factors and insulin resistance do not have a significant effect on telaprevir-based treatment efficacy.","Adolescent
