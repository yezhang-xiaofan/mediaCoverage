It is being actively evaluated in clinical trials for melanoma. The mTOR inhibitors are also immunosuppressants and are used clinically to prevent rejection following solid-organ transplant. Novel immunotherapies are being actively developed for immunoresponsive tumours, such as RCC and melanoma. METHODS: Immune-modulating effects of temsirolimus were characterised when used in combination with cancer vaccines targeting RCC (RENCA) and melanoma (B16). Cancer vaccines were recombinant tumour-specific proteins (CA9 or gp100), and recombinant heat shock protein (HSP; hsp110) served as the immune adjuvant. RESULTS: In murine models, temsirolimus enhanced the anti-tumour activity of cancer vaccines used to treat established RENCA and B16 tumours. A tumour prevention model established that the enhanced anti-tumour activity associated with temsirolimus was immune mediated. In mice treated with an HSP-based anti-tumour vaccine, temsirolimus-treated CD8 T cells had greater interferon-gamma and cytotoxic T-cell responses when compared with mice treated with vaccine alone. Temsirolimus also enhanced the formation of CD8 memory cells following administration of HSP-based cancer vaccine. CONCLUSION: These results provide a rationale for combining mTOR inhibitor with immunotherapy when treating immunoresponsive tumours.","Animals
