20862559,Familial dyslexia in a large Swedish family: a whole genome linkage scan.,Behavior genetics,Svensson I and Nilsson S and Wahlstrom J and Jernas M and Carlsson LM and Hjelmquist E,Missing,"There is a compelling body of evidence that developmental dyslexia runs in families and seems to be highly inheritable. Several investigations during the last two decades have shown possible locations of genes that might be involved in dyslexia, including regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 15 and 18. In addition, six candidate genes (KIAA0319, DYX1C1, DCDC2, ROBO1, MRPL19 and C2ORF3) seem to be related to dyslexia. The present study carried out a whole genome scan in a six-generation pedigree. In addition to literacy skills the assessment included cognitive skills and records concerning the history of reading and writing ability. Thirty-five percent were regarded as dyslexic in the family. A linkage analysis using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach has been performed. No evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that the transmission of dyslexia in this pedigree is due to a highly penetrant major gene, and previous linkage findings were not replicated; however, power in this small study was not adequate to confirm linkage of genes with small to moderate effects. The results were discussed in relation to diagnostic procedures and sample characteristics.","Adolescent
