21641390,Characterization of the cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor in novel expression sites of the gastrointestinal tract.,The American journal of pathology,Barajas-Espinosa A and Ochoa-Cortes F and Moos MP and Ramirez FD and Vanner SJ and Funk CD,Missing,"Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs: LTC(4), LTD(4), and LTE(4)) are pro-inflammatory lipid molecules synthesized from arachidonic acid. They exert their actions on at least two cysLT receptors (CysLT(1)R and CysLT(2)R). Endothelial expression and activation of these receptors is linked to vasoactive responses and to the promotion of vascular permeability. Here we track the expression pattern of CysLT(2)R in a loss-of-function murine model (CysLT(2)R-LacZ) to neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexus in the small intestine, colonic myenteric plexus, dorsal root ganglia, and nodose ganglion. Cysteinyl leukotriene (LTC(4)/D(4)) stimulation of colonic submucosal venules elicited a greater permeability response in wild-type mice. In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colon inflammation model, the disease activity index and colonic edema (measured by wet:dry weights and submucosal thickness) were significantly reduced in knockout (KO) mice compared to controls. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in colon tissue were significantly lower in KO mice; however, myeloperoxidase activity was similar in both the KO and wild-type groups. Finally, patch-clamp recordings of basal neuronal activity of colonic-projecting nociceptive neurons from dorsal root ganglia (T9-13) revealed significantly higher excitability in KO neurons compared to wild type. These results suggest that a lack of neuronal expression of CysLT(2)R in the murine colonic myenteric plexus attenuates colitis disease progression via a reduction in inflammation-associated tissue edema and increases neuronal sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli.","Action Potentials/drug effects
