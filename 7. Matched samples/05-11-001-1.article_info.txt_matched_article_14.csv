21224053,Tissue eosinophilia in a mouse model of colitis is highly dependent on TLR2 and independent of mast cells.,The American journal of pathology,Albert EJ and Duplisea J and Dawicki W and Haidl ID and Marshall JS,Missing,"The mechanisms initiating eosinophil influx into sites of inflammation have been well studied in allergic disease but are poorly understood in other settings. This study examined the roles of TLR2 and mast cells in eosinophil accumulation during a nonallergic model of eosinophilia-associated colitis. TLR2-deficient mice (TLR2(-/-)) developed a more severe colitis than wild-type mice in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model. However, they had significantly fewer eosinophils in the submucosa of the cecum (P < 0.01) and mid-colon (P < 0.01) than did wild-type mice after DSS treatment. Decreased eosinophilia in TLR2(-/-) mice was associated with lower levels of cecal CCL11 (P < 0.01). Peritoneal eosinophils did not express TLR2 protein, but TLR2 ligand injection into the peritoneal cavity induced local eosinophil recruitment, indicating that TLR2 activation of other cell types can mediate eosinophil recruitment. After DSS treatment, mast cell-deficient (Kit(W-sh/W-sh)) mice had similar levels of intestinal tissue eosinophilia were observed as those in wild-type mice. However, mast cell-deficient mice were partially protected from DSS-induced weight loss, an effect that was reversed by mast cell reconstitution. Overall, this study indicates a critical role for indirect TLR2-dependent pathways, but not mast cells, in the generation of eosinophilia in the large intestine during experimental colitis and has important implications for the regulation of eosinophils at mucosal inflammatory sites.","Animals
