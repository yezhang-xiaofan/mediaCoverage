21292811,CD73-deficient mice have increased antitumor immunity and are resistant to experimental metastasis.,Cancer research,Stagg J and Divisekera U and Duret H and Sparwasser T and Teng MW and Darcy PK and Smyth MJ,Missing,"CD73 is a cell-surface enzyme that suppresses immune responses by producing extracellular adenosine. In this study, we employed CD73 gene-targeted mice to investigate the role of host-derived CD73 on antitumor immunity and tumor cell metastasis. We found that CD73 ablation significantly suppressed the growth of ovalbumin-expressing MC38 colon cancer, EG7 lymphoma, AT-3 mammary tumors, and B16F10 melanoma. The protective effect of CD73 deficiency on primary tumors was dependent on CD8(+) T cells and associated with an increased frequency of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood and tumors and increased antigen-specific IFN-gamma production. Replicate studies in bone marrow chimeras established that both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic expression of CD73 was important to promote tumor immune escape. Using adoptive reconstitution of T regulatory cell (Treg)-depleted DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells) mice, we demonstrated that part of the protumorigenic effect of Tregs was dependent on their expression of CD73. CD73-deficient mice were also protected against pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells after intravenous injection. Unexpectedly, we found that the prometastatic effect of host-derived CD73 was dependent on CD73 expression on nonhematopoietic cells. CD73 expression on nonhematopoietic cells, most likely endothelial cells, was critical for promoting lung metastasis in a manner independent from immunosuppressive effects. Notably, in vivo blockade of CD73 with a selective inhibitor or anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis of CD73-negative tumors. Taken together, our findings indicate that CD73 may be targeted at multiple levels to induce anticancer effects including at the level of tumor cells, Tregs, and nonhematopoietic cells.","5'-Nucleotidase/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*deficiency/*immunology
