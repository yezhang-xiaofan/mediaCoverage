21641403,Neuroprotective effects of the cellular prion protein in autoimmune optic neuritis.,The American journal of pathology,Williams SK and Fairless R and Weise J and Kalinke U and Schulz-Schaeffer W and Diem R,Missing,"Although the pathologic role of the prion protein in transmissible spongiform encephalopathic diseases has been widely investigated, the physiologic role of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is not known. Among the many functions attributed to PrP(C), there is increasing evidence that it is involved in cell survival and mediates neuroprotection. A potential role in the immune response has also been suggested. However, how these two functions interplay in autoimmune disease is unclear. To address this, autoimmune optic neuritis, a model of multiple sclerosis, was induced in C57Bl/6 mice, and up-regulation of PrP(C) was observed throughout the disease course. In addition, compared with wild-type mice, in PrP(C)-deficient mice and mice overexpressing PrP(C), histopathologic analysis demonstrated that optic neuritis was exacerbated, as indicated by axonal degeneration, inflammatory infiltration, and demyelination. However, significant neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells, the axons of which form the optic nerve, was observed in mice that overexpressed PrP(C). Conversely, mice lacking PrP(C) demonstrated significantly more neurodegeneration. This suggests that PrP(C) may have a neuroprotective function independent of its role in regulating the immune response.","Animals
