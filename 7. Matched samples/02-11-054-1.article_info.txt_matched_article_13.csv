21694460,Detection of amyloid-beta protein precursor homo-interactions using beta-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,So PP and Chen CD and Abraham CR,Missing,"Amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) produces amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Experimental evidence suggests that increased dimerization of AbetaPP increases Abeta while decreased dimerization of AbetaPP decreases Abeta production. If true, developing tools for detecting AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions to understand AbetaPP processing leading to Abeta production would be important. Here, we developed the method of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) enzyme fragment complementation as a means to detect AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions. Inactive beta-gal fragments are independently tagged to the C-terminal ends of monomeric AbetaPPs, and will come together to form a functional enzyme upon AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions. Successful detection of beta-gal activity has been used to qualitatively visualize and quantify the amount of AbetaPP dimers or higher oligomers. This method can be used to enhance our understanding of the biological processes dependent upon AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions.","Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*chemistry/genetics
