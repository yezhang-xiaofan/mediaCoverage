21796615,Development of squamous neoplasia in esophageal iodine-unstained lesions and the alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase genotypes of Japanese alcoholic men.,International journal of cancer. Journal international du cancer,Yokoyama A and Hirota T and Omori T and Yokoyama T and Kawakubo H and Matsui T and Mizukami T and Mori S and Sugiura H and Maruyama K,Missing,"We investigated the development of esophageal neoplasia in biopsy specimens of the distinct iodine-unstained lesions (DIULs) >/= 5 mm detected in 280 of 2,115 Japanese alcoholic men who underwent screening by esophageal iodine staining. Low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) was diagnosed in 155 of them, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) in 57, and invasive SCC in 35. The size of the DIULs increased with the degree of neoplasia. Most LGINs were flat and were missed before iodine staining. Some DIULs became a light pink color (PC) about 2 min after staining, and 2.6, 56.1 and 96.0% of the LGIN, HGIN and invasive SCC lesions, respectively, were PC-sign-positive. Multiple DIULs of any size markedly increased the risk of LGIN [adjusted OR (95%CI) = 10.1 (7.12-14.5)], HGIN [27.9 (14.6-53.4)] and invasive SCC [21.6 (10.1-46.4)], and were strongly associated with the presence vs. absence of DIULs >/= 5 mm [13.3 (9.21-19.1)], inactive heterozygous aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2*1/*2) vs. ALDH2*1/*1 [2.60 (1.79-3.78)], and less-active alcohol dehydrogenase-1B (ADH1B*1/*1) vs. ADH1B*2 allele [2.61 (1.87-3.64)]. The combination of ALDH2*1/*2 and ADH1B*1/*1 synergistically increased the risk of LGIN [4.53 (2.17-9.47)], HGIN [10.4 (4.34-24.7)] and invasive SCC [21.7 (7.96-59.3)]. Esophageal neoplasia developed at earlier ages in those with ALDH2*1/*2. Biopsy-proven HGIN was diagnosed as invasive SCC in 15 (39.5%) of 38 patients after endoscopic mucosectomy or surgery. In conclusion, large size, non-flat appearance, positive PC sign and multiplicity of DIULs and ALDH2*1/*2 and ADH1B*1/*1 were associated with development of esophageal neoplasia in Japanese alcoholics. Biopsy-proven HGIN should be totally resected for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","Adult
