Little is known about components of adult height in relation to mortality, particularly in developing countries. METHODS: We examined the association of adult height and its components (leg and trunk length) with mortality using data from 74 869 Chinese women and 61,333 men in the Shanghai Women's (1996-2008) and Men's (2002-2008) Health Studies. Anthropometric measurements, including standing and sitting height and weight, were taken at baseline by trained interviewers according to a standard protocol. Deaths were ascertained by biennial home visits and linkage with the vital statistics registry. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations. RESULTS: Neither height nor its components were associated with all-cause mortality. Height and, less consistently, its components were positively associated with cancer mortality, but inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for cancer mortality per 1-SD increment in height, trunk and leg length were 1.06 (1.01-1.12), 1.07 (1.01-1.12) and 1.03 (0.98-1.08), respectively, in women, and 1.13 (1.05-1.22), 1.09 (1.00-1.19) and 1.10 (1.03-1.16), respectively, in men. The corresponding HRs for CVD mortality were 0.89 (0.84-0.95), 0.93 (0.87-0.99) and 0.91 (0.86-0.98) in women, and 0.93 (0.86-1.02), 0.89 (0.81-0.98) and 0.99 (0.92-1.06) in men. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in linking height and its components with cancer and CVD mortality.","Adult
