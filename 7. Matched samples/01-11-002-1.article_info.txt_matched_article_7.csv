METHODS: Serum BDNF concentrations were assayed by ELISA and fitness was assessed using a standardized exercise stress test. The Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), California Verbal Learning Test 2nd Ed., Stroop, Trail Making Test B and the Digit Symbol-Coding task were administered. The val66met BDNF genotype and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were determined as potential confounders. RESULTS: In subjects with CAD (n=88; 85.2% male, mean age 62.8+/-10.5 yr), cardiopulmonary fitness was associated with higher serum BDNF concentrations (beta=.305, p=.013). Higher serum BDNF concentrations were associated with higher MMSE scores (F(1,87)=15.406, p<.0005) and better performance on the Digit Symbol-Coding task (F(1,87)=9.620, p=.003). IL-6, TNF-alpha and the val66met genotype did not influence these results. CONCLUSION: Serum BDNF concentrations were associated with cardiopulmonary fitness, psychomotor processing speed and overall cognition in subjects with CAD.","Aged
