Our objective was to investigate the association between sHSP27, neuropathic signs and nerve function in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Participants were recruited consecutively from the population-based Vasterbotten Intervention Program (NGT, n = 39, IGT, n = 29, and type 2 diabetes, n = 51) and were matched for age and sex. sHSP27 levels were measured and nerve conduction studies were performed (peroneal and sural nerves). z Scores for each nerve conduction measure were calculated and compiled into a composite z score for the leg. Neuropathy disability score (NDS) was used to assess neuropathic signs. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes had significantly lower sHSP27 levels (geometric mean sHSP27 206 pg/ml, 95% CI 142, 299) than those with IGT (geometric mean sHSP27 455 pg/ml, 95% CI 319, 650, p < 0.05) and controls (geometric mean sHSP27 361 pg/ml, 95% CI 282, 461, p < 0.05). Participants with few signs of neuropathy (first tertile, NDS </=2) had significantly higher sHSP27 levels (geometric mean sHSP27 401 pg/ml, 95% CI 310, 520) than participants with many signs (third tertile, NDS >/=7) (geometric mean sHSP27 192 pg/ml, 95% CI 128, 288, p = 0.007). The highest sHSP27 tertile was associated with better nerve function, adjusted for age, sex, statin medication and HbA(1c) (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.25, 5.05, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High sHSP27 levels were associated with better nerve function and fewer neuropathic signs in NGT, IGT and type 2 diabetes.","Blood Glucose/physiology
