21378219,Update in growth hormone therapy of children.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Collett-Solberg PF,Missing,"Although recombinant human GH (rhGH) has been available since 1985, there are several questions related to its use that remain unanswered. The Entrez-PubMed search engine was used to conduct a review of publications appearing since 2007 that address growth and GH treatment. Recent publications related to the diagnosis of GH deficiency, genetics of growth, the use of rhGH in different genetic conditions, in idiopathic short stature, and in puberty, and strategies to adjust rhGH dose were reviewed. New studies investigating the genetics of growth and the response to rhGH therapy in different groups are helping in the understanding of the physiology of normal growth. Although in most children treated with rhGH there is a short-term benefit, the clinical relevance of the benefits after long-term treatment in some conditions remains unclear. The challenges are to define milder forms of GH deficiency and to assess the relevance of the benefits, if any, caused by rhGH in different patient populations and the best therapeutic approach for these patients. Well-designed long-term studies using anthropometric, genetic, and laboratory data that will also assess long-term quality of life benefits are needed to help clinicians select patients to initiate treatment with rhGH and to adjust treatment to improve outcome.","Adolescent
