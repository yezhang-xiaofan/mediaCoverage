21618065,Predictive factors of participation in postsecondary education for high school leavers with autism.,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,Chiang HM and Cheung YK and Hickson L and Xiang R and Tsai LY,columbia,"This exploratory study was designed to identify the factors predictive of participation in postsecondary education for high school leavers with autism. A secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) data was performed for this study. Potential predictors of participation in postsecondary education were assessed using a backward logistic regression analysis. This study found that the high school's primary post-high school goal for the student, parental expectations, high school type, annual household income, and academic performance were significant predictors of participation in postsecondary education. The findings of this current study may provide critical information for parents of children with autism as well as educators and professionals who work with students with autism.","Adolescent
