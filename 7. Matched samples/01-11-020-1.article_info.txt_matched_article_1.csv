22093022,Tooth loss in periodontally treated patients: a long-term study of periodontal disease and root caries.,Journal of clinical periodontology,Ravald N and Johansson CS,Missing,"AIM: To study periodontal conditions, root caries, number of lost teeth and causes for tooth loss during 11-14 years after active periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients participated in the follow-up study. Reasons for tooth loss were identified through previous case books, radiographs and clinical photos. To identify factors contributing to tooth loss, a logistic multilevel regression analysis was used. RESULTS: The number of lost teeth was 211. The main reason was periodontal disease (n = 153). Due to root caries and endodontic complications, 28 and 17 teeth, respectively, were lost. Thirteen teeth were lost for other reasons. The number of teeth (p = 0.05) and prevalence of probing pocket depths, 4-6 mm (p = 0.01) at baseline, smoking (p = 0.01) and the number of visits at dental hygienists (p = 0.03) during maintenance, significantly contributed to explain the variation in tooth loss. CONCLUSION: Previously treated patients at a specialist clinic for periodontology continued to lose teeth in spite of maintenance treatments at general practitioners and dental hygienists. The main reason for tooth loss was periodontal disease. Tooth loss was significantly more prevalent among smokers than non-smokers. Tooth-related risk factors were smoking, low numbers of teeth and prevalence of periodontal pockets, 4-6 mm.","Adult
