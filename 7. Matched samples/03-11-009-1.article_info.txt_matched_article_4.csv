21336308,Inactivation of Rheb by PRAK-mediated phosphorylation is essential for energy-depletion-induced suppression of mTORC1.,Nature cell biology,Zheng M and Wang YH and Wu XN and Wu SQ and Lu BJ and Dong MQ and Zhang H and Sun P and Lin SC and Guan KL and Han J,Missing,"Cell growth can be suppressed by stressful environments, but the role of stress pathways in this process is largely unknown. Here we show that a cascade of p38beta mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38-regulated/activated kinase (PRAK) plays a role in energy-starvation-induced suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and that energy starvation activates the p38beta-PRAK cascade. Depletion of p38beta or PRAK diminishes the suppression of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and reduction of cell size induced by energy starvation. We show that p38beta-PRAK operates independently of the known mTORC1 inactivation pathways--phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2) and Raptor by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)--and surprisingly, that PRAK directly regulates Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a key component of the mTORC1 pathway, by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Rheb at Ser 130 by PRAK impairs the nucleotide-binding ability of Rheb and inhibits Rheb-mediated mTORC1 activation. The direct regulation of Rheb by PRAK integrates a stress pathway with the mTORC1 pathway in response to energy depletion.","AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism
