21732091,Molecular advances in reporter genes: the need to witness the function of stem cells in failing heart in vivo.,Stem cell reviews,Agostini S and Recchia FA and Lionetti V,Missing,"Stem cells possess the ability to terminally differentiate in cell phenotypes belonging to several different lineages. Over the last decade, transplant of adult stem cells into the injuried myocardium has been widely studied as a revolutionary approach to promote the non-pharmacological improvement or replacement of the lost function. In spite of the tantalizing perspectives and controversial results, several questions about the viability and biology of transplanted stem cells in the beating heart still remain unanswered, mostly because of the current technological limitations. Recent advances in bio- and nano-technology are allowing the development of molecular probes for imaging thus providing a better understanding of stem cells physiology and fate in vivo. Reporter gene based molecular imaging is a high-throughput and sensitive tool used to unscramble over time the mechanisms underlying cell-induced myocardial repair in vivo. To date, the employed reporter genes have been exogenous (proteins which are expressed after gene engineering), or endogenous (detected by tracer substrates). This review will highlight current and outstanding experimental investigations, which are developing new probes to monitor the fate of stem cells transplanted in failing myocardium in vivo.","Animals
