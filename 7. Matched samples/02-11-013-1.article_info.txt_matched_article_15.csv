21184262,"Physical activity, additional breast cancer events, and mortality among early-stage breast cancer survivors: findings from the WHEL Study.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,Bertram LA and Stefanick ML and Saquib N and Natarajan L and Patterson RE and Bardwell W and Flatt SW and Newman VA and Rock CL and Thomson CA and Pierce JP,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: Research suggests that physical activity is associated with improved breast cancer survival, yet no studies have examined the association between post-diagnosis changes in physical activity and breast cancer outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether baseline activity and 1-year change in activity are associated with breast cancer events or mortality. METHODS: A total of 2,361 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stage I-III) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of dietary change completed physical activity measures at baseline and one year. Physical activity variables (total, moderate-vigorous, and adherence to guidelines) were calculated for each time point. Median follow-up was 7.1 years. Outcomes were invasive breast cancer events and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Those who were most active at baseline had a 53% lower mortality risk compared to the least active women (HR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.84; p = .01). Adherence to activity guidelines was associated with a 35% lower mortality risk (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p < .01). Neither baseline nor 1-year change in activity was associated with additional breast cancer events. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline (post-treatment) physical activity was associated with improved survival. However, change in activity over the following year was not associated with outcomes. These data suggest that long-term physical activity levels are important for breast cancer prognosis.","Activities of Daily Living
