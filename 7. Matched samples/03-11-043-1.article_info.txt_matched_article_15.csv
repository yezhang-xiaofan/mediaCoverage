22313152,A network method of measuring affiliation-based peer influence: assessing the influences of teammates' smoking on adolescent smoking.,Child development,Fujimoto K and Unger JB and Valente TW,tmc,"Using a network analytic framework, this study introduces a new method to measure peer influence based on adolescents' affiliations or 2-mode social network data. Exposure based on affiliations is referred to as the ""affiliation exposure model."" This study demonstrates the methodology using data on young adolescent smoking being influenced by joint participation in school-based organized sports activities with smokers. The analytic sample consisted of 1,260 American adolescents from ages 10 to 13 in middle schools, and the results of the longitudinal regression analyses showed that adolescents were more likely to smoke as they were increasingly exposed to teammates who smoke. This study illustrates the importance of peer influence via affiliation through team sports.","Adolescent
