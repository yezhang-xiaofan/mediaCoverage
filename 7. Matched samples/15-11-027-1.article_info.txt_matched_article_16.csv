21709371,Anti-Amyloid-beta Single-Chain Antibody Brain Delivery Via AAV Reduces Amyloid Load But May Increase Cerebral Hemorrhages in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Kou J and Kim H and Pattanayak A and Song M and Lim JE and Taguchi H and Paul S and Cirrito JR and Ponnazhagan S and Fukuchi K,Missing,"Accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain is thought to be a causal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeting Abeta holds great promise for reducing Abeta in the brain. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-Abeta single-chain antibody (scFv59) delivery via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) on reducing Abeta deposits in an AD mouse model (TgAbetaPPswe/PS1dE9). First, delivery of scFv59 to the brain was optimized by injecting rAAV serotypes 1, 2, and 5 into the right lateral ventricle. Symmetrical high expression of scFv59 was found throughout the hippocampus and partly in the neocortex in both hemispheres via rAAV1 or rAAV5, while scFv59 expression via rAAV2 was mostly limited to one hemisphere. rAAV1, however, induced apoptosis and microglial activation but rAAV5 did not. Therefore, rAAV5 was selected for therapeutic scFv59 delivery in TgAbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. rAAV5 was similarly injected into the ventricle of 10-month-old TgAbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice and 5 months later its efficacy and safety were evaluated. Immunoreactive Abeta deposits reduced in the hippocampus. Abeta42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tended to increase and the Abeta40 : 42 ratio decreased in CSF, suggesting that Abeta42 was relocated from the parenchyma to CSF. Hemorrhages associated with a focal increase in blood vessel amyloid were found in the brain. While immunotherapy has great potential for clearing cerebral Abeta, caution for cerebrovascular effects should be exercised when rAAV-mediated anti-Abeta immunotherapy is applied.","Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy
