A study with ileostomists showed that starches acylated with specific SCFAs largely survive passage through the small intestine, but the percentage released in the colon has not been established. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the percentage of ingested esterified butyrate released in the human gastrointestinal tract. DESIGN: The study was a randomized, crossover, controlled trial consisting of baseline and four 2-wk periods during which 16 volunteers consumed diets low in resistant starch plus 20 and 40 g cooked high-amylose maize starch (HAMS: HAMS20 or HAMS40) or butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB20 or HAMSB40) daily. HAMSB20 contained 31.8 mmol esterified butyrate. Complete 48-h fecal collections were made on days 2-3 and 12-13 of each period. RESULTS: Free fecal butyrate concentrations were higher after HAMSB40 than after HAMSB20 (P < 0.005) and HAMS (P < 0.0001) and higher than baseline data (P < 0.0001). Fecal esterified butyrate concentrations were highest in the HAMSB40 (days 12-13; P < 0.0001) group, and concentrations in the HAMSB40 (days 2-3) and HAMSB20 groups were higher than those in the HAMS groups and those at baseline (P < 0.0001). Ingestion of HAMSB20 and HAMSB40 resulted in the release of 26.8 +/- 1.0 and 50.2 +/- 2.4 mmol butyrate/d (days 12-13) (84.2 +/- 3.0% and 79.0 +/- 3.1% of total ingested esterified butyrate), respectively, in the gastrointestinal tract. By calculation, approximately 57.2% of ingested esterified butyrate was released in the colon. Microbial analysis showed that this release was probably facilitated mainly by Parabacteroides distasonis, which increased in abundance with HAMSB40 (days 12-13) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that cooked butyrylated starch delivers esterified butyrate to the human colon effectively and has the potential to improve human bowel health.
