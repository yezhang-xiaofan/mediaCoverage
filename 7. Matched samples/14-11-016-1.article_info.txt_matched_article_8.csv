21233205,Identification of an in vitro interaction between an insect immune suppressor protein (CrV2) and G alpha proteins.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Cooper TH and Bailey-Hill K and Leifert WR and McMurchie EJ and Asgari S and Glatz RV,Missing,"The protein CrV2 is encoded by a polydnavirus integrated into the genome of the endoparasitoid Cotesia rubecula (Hymenoptera:Braconidae:Microgastrinae) and is expressed in host larvae with other gene products of the polydnavirus to allow successful development of the parasitoid. CrV2 expression has previously been associated with immune suppression, although the molecular basis for this was not known. Here, we have used time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) to demonstrate high affinity binding of CrV2 to Galpha subunits (but not the Gbetagamma dimer) of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Signals up to 5-fold above background were generated, and an apparent dissociation constant of 6.2 nm was calculated. Protease treatment abolished the TR-FRET signal, and the presence of unlabeled CrV2 or Galpha proteins also reduced the TR-FRET signal. The activation state of the Galpha subunit was altered with aluminum fluoride, and this decreased the affinity of the interaction with CrV2. It was also demonstrated that CrV2 preferentially bound to Drosophila Galpha(o) compared with rat Galpha(i1). In addition, three CrV2 homologs were detected in sequences derived from polydnaviruses from Cotesia plutellae and Cotesia congregata (including the immune-related early expressed transcript, EP2). These data suggest a potential mode-of-action of immune suppressors not previously reported, which in addition to furthering our understanding of insect immunity may have practical benefits such as facilitating development of novel controls for pest insect species.","Animals
