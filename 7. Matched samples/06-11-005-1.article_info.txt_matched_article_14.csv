21326246,Phase II study of S-1 combined with oxaliplatin as therapy for patients with metastatic biliary tract cancer: influence of the CYP2A6 polymorphism on pharmacokinetics and clinical activity.,British journal of cancer,Kim KP and Jang G and Hong YS and Lim HS and Bae KS and Kim HS and Lee SS and Shin JG and Lee JL and Ryu MH and Chang HM and Kang YK and Kim TW,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Advanced biliary cancer is often treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a combination of S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug, and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic biliary cancer. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic biliary cancer and no history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy were enrolled. Oxaliplatin was administered intravenously (130 mg m(-2)), followed by 14-day administration of oral S-1 (40 mg m(-2) twice daily) with a subsequent 7-day rest period every 21 days. Pharmacokinetic analysis of S-1 was performed at cycle 1. Patients were genotyped for CYP2A6 polymorphisms ((*)1, (*)4, (*)7, (*)9 or (*)10), and pharmacokinetic and clinical parameters compared according to the CYP2A6 genotype. RESULTS: In total, 49 patients were evaluated, who received a median of four cycles. The overall response rate was 24.5%. Median progression-free and overall survival was 3.7 and 8.7 months, respectively. The most common haematological grade 3 out of 4 toxicity was neutropenia (14%), while non-hematological grade 3 out of 4 toxicities included anorexia (14%), nausea (12%), asthenia (10%), vomiting (10%), and diarrhoea (4%). Biotransformation of S-1 (AUC(0-24 h) of 5-fluorouracil/AUC(0-24 h) of tegafur) was 1.85-fold higher for the *1/*1 group than for the other groups (90% confidence interval 1.37-2.49). Diarrhoea (P=0.0740), neutropenia (P=0.396), and clinical efficacy (response rate, P=0.583; PFS, P=0.916) were not significantly associated with CYP2A6 genotype, despite differences in 5-FU exposure. CONCLUSION: The combination of S-1 and oxaliplatin appears to be active and well tolerated in patients with metastatic biliary cancer, and thus is feasible as a therapeutic modality. CYP2A6 genotypes are associated with differences in the biotransformation of S-1. However, the impact of the CYP2A6 polymorphism on variations in clinical efficacy or toxicity requires further evaluation.","Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology
