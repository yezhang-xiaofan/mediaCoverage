MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 392 COPD patients were divided into frequent and infrequent exacerbation (>/=2 times and <2 times in last 12 months) groups. Their lung function and periodontal status were examined. Information on oral hygiene behaviours was obtained by interview. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, fewer remaining teeth, high plaque index (PLI) scores, low tooth brushing times, and low regular supra-gingival scaling were significantly associated with COPD exacerbations (all p-values <0.05). After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, COPD severity and dyspnoea severity, the associations with fewer remaining teeth (p = 0.02), high PLI scores (p = 0.02) and low tooth brushing times (p = 0.008) remained statistically significant. When stratified by smoking, fewer remaining teeth (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.04-4.02) and low tooth brushing times (OR = 4.90, 95% CI: 1.26-19.1) among past smokers and high PLI scores (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.19-9.94) among never smokers were significantly associated with COPD exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer remaining teeth, high PLI scores, and low tooth brushing times are significant correlates of COPD exacerbations, indicating that improving periodontal health and oral hygiene may be a potentially preventive strategy against COPD exacerbations.","Aged
