21641409,Increased vascular delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy after inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-B.,The American journal of pathology,Falcon BL and Pietras K and Chou J and Chen D and Sennino B and Hanahan D and McDonald DM,Missing,"Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) has multiple effects on tumors, including loss of pericytes, regression of some vessels, normalization of other vessels, and reduction of interstitial pressure. PDGF-B inhibition also increases the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, but the role on tumor vessel efficiency and drug delivery is unclear. We sought to determine whether inhibition of PDGF-B signaling can increase delivery and efficacy of cyclophosphamide in Lewis lung carcinomas or RIP-Tag2 tumors. PDGF-B blockade in Lewis lung carcinoma tumors by the DNA aptamer AX102 for 14 days increased the number of perfused tumor vessels marked by lectin in the bloodstream by 50%. AX102 also increased the width of sleeves of viable tumor cells around blood vessels by 66%, increased tumor cell proliferation by 90%, and increased intratumoral delivery of Hoechst 33342 by 78%. A low dose of cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg) reduced tumor cell proliferation by 31% when combined with AX102 but not when given alone. Synergy of cyclophosphamide and AX102 on tumor cell proliferation also was found in RIP-Tag2 tumors. Similarly, the PDGF receptor signaling inhibitor imatinib increased delivery of cyclophosphamide and reduced tumor burden in RIP-Tag2 mice, without evidence of tumor cell sensitization to chemotherapy. Together, these findings indicate that inhibition of PDGF-B signaling promotes the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents by increasing the efficiency of tumor blood vessels.","Animals
