21343303,Hepatic deficiency of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 reduces high density lipoprotein secretion and plasma levels in mice.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Basford JE and Wancata L and Hofmann SM and Silva RA and Davidson WS and Howles PN and Hui DY,Missing,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is known to serve as a chylomicron remnant receptor in the liver responsible for the binding and plasma clearance of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. Previous in vitro studies have provided evidence to suggest that LRP1 expression may also influence high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. The current study showed that liver-specific LRP1 knock-out (hLrp1(-/-)) mice displayed lower fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels when compared with hLrp1(+/+) mice. Lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase and hepatic lipase activities in plasma of hLrp1(-/-) mice were comparable with those observed in hLrp1(+/+) mice, indicating that hepatic LRP1 inactivation does not influence plasma HDL remodeling. Plasma clearance of HDL particles and HDL-associated cholesteryl esters was also similar between hLrp1(+/+) and hLrp1(-/-) mice. In contrast, HDL secretion from primary hepatocytes isolated from hLrp1(-/-) mice was significantly reduced when compared with that observed with hLrp1(+/+) hepatocytes. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins revealed decreased surface localization of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) protein, but total cellular ABCA1 level was not changed in hLrp1(-/-) hepatocytes. Finally, hLrp1(-/-) hepatocytes displayed reduced binding capacity for extracellular cathepsin D, resulting in lower intracellular cathepsin D content and impairment of prosaposin activation, a process that is required for membrane translocation of ABCA1 to facilitate cholesterol efflux and HDL secretion. Taken together, these results documented that hepatic LRP1 participates in cellular activation of lysosomal enzymes and through this mechanism, indirectly modulates the production and plasma levels of HDL.","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1
