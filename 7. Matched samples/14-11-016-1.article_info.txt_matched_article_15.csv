21266580,Thrombin induces NF-kappaB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression in lung epithelial cells by a Rac1-dependent PI3K/Akt pathway.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Lin CH and Cheng HW and Ma HP and Wu CH and Hong CY and Chen BC,Missing,"We previously showed that thrombin induces interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 expression via the protein kinase C (PKC)alpha/c-Src-dependent IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKKalpha/beta)/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in human lung epithelial cells. In this study, we further investigated the roles of Rac1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt in thrombin-induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression. Thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release and IL-8/CXCL8-luciferase activity were attenuated by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), an Akt inhibitor (1-L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-((R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate)), and the dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (RacN17) and Akt (AktDN). Treatment of cells with thrombin caused activation of Rac and Akt. The thrombin-induced increase in Akt activation was inhibited by RacN17 and LY294002. Stimulation of cells with thrombin resulted in increases in IKKalpha/beta activation and kappaB-luciferase activity; these effects were inhibited by RacN17, LY294002, an Akt inhibitor, and AktDN. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gbetagamma, p85alpha, and Rac1 complex formation in a time-dependent manner. These results imply that thrombin activates the Rac1/PI3K/Akt pathway through formation of the Gbetagamma, Rac1, and p85alpha complex to induce IKKalpha/beta activation, NF-kappaB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expression in human lung epithelial cells.","Amino Acid Substitution
