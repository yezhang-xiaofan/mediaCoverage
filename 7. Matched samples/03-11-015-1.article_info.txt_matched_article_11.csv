21439991,Words and pictures: an electrophysiological investigation of domain specific processing in native Chinese and English speakers.,Neuropsychologia,Yum YN and Holcomb PJ and Grainger J,tufts,"Comparisons of word and picture processing using event-related potentials (ERPs) are contaminated by gross physical differences between the two types of stimuli. In the present study, we tackle this problem by comparing picture processing with word processing in an alphabetic and a logographic script, that are also characterized by gross physical differences. Native Mandarin Chinese speakers viewed pictures (line drawings) and Chinese characters (Experiment 1), native English speakers viewed pictures and English words (Experiment 2), and naive Chinese readers (native English speakers) viewed pictures and Chinese characters (Experiment 3) in a semantic categorization task. The varying pattern of differences in the ERPs elicited by pictures and words across the three experiments provided evidence for (i) script-specific processing arising between 150 and 200 ms post-stimulus onset, (ii) domain-specific but script-independent processing arising between 200 and 300 ms post-stimulus onset, and (iii) processing that depended on stimulus meaningfulness in the N400 time window. The results are interpreted in terms of differences in the way visual features are mapped onto higher-level representations for pictures and words in alphabetic and logographic writing systems.","Cerebral Cortex/*physiology
