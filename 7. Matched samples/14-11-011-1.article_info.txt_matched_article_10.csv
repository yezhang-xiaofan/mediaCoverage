21349841,Keratinocyte-derived laminin-332 promotes adhesion and migration in melanocytes and melanoma.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Chung H and Suh EK and Han IO and Oh ES,Missing,"Melanocytes are highly motile cells that play an integral role in basic skin physiological processes such as wound healing and proper skin pigmentation. It has been postulated that surrounding keratinocytes contribute to melanocyte migration, but underlying mechanisms remain rather vague so far. In this study, we set out to analyze the specific potential contribution of keratinocyte components to melanocytes and melanoma cell migration-related processes. Our studies revealed that A375 human melanoma cell attachment, spreading, and migration are interestingly better supported by HaCaT keratinocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) than by self-derived A375 ECM. Moreover, HaCaT ECM caused increased integrin alpha6 expression, adhesion-mediated focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, and focal adhesion formations. Similar effects were confirmed in human melanocytes. Furthermore, we found that keratinocyte-derived soluble factors did not appear to significantly contribute to these processes. Specific extrinsic factors that promoted melanoma migration were attributed to keratinocyte-derived laminin-332, whereas alternative ECM component such as laminin-111 and fibronectin functions appeared to have insignificant contributions. Taken together, these studies implicate extrinsic laminin-332 in promoting the high mobility property and perhaps invasiveness inherently characteristic of, and that are the menace of, melanocytes and melanomas, respectively.","Cell Adhesion
