21646264,Targeting inflammation to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia: can new insights be translated into therapies?,Pediatrics,Wright CJ and Kirpalani H,chop,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) frequently complicates preterm birth and leads to significant long-term morbidity. Unfortunately, few therapies are known to effectively prevent or treat BPD. Ongoing research has been focusing on potential therapies to limit inflammation in the preterm lung. In this review we highlight recent bench and clinical research aimed at understanding the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of BPD. We also critically assess currently used therapies and promising developments in the field.","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia/etiology/*prevention & control
