21501365,Nuclear remodelling during viral infections.,Cellular microbiology,Zakaryan H and Stamminger T,Missing,"Because of their limited coding capacity, viruses are not able to encode all proteins that are required for their replication. Therefore, they depend on a wide variety of cellular functions and structures, such as the host cell nucleus. It has been shown that DNA, as well as RNA viruses, exploit the nucleus because it provides essential machinery for viral replication. On the other hand, the nucleus undergoes significant remodelling during viral usurpation or exploitation. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that some subnuclear structures, such as promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies, act as an antiviral defence mechanism, and several viruses antagonize this intracellular defence by modifying subnuclear structures. This article reviews the main alterations that take place in nucleus during viral infections.","Cell Nucleus/*virology
