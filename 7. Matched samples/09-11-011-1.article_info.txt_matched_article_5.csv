METHODS: The Early Stage Prostate Cancer Cohort Study is an observational cohort of 1,037 men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, T(0-3)N(x)M(0). High-grade prostate cancer was defined as a biopsy Gleason score >/= 7 (4 + 3). Logistic regression models were created to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the cross-sectional relationship between height and prostate cancer grade in the overall cohort and subpopulations. RESULTS: We identified 939 participants with a biopsy Gleason score. High-grade prostate cancer was diagnosed in 138 participants. Overall, participants in the highest quartile of height were more than twice as likely to have a Gleason score >/= 7 (4 + 3) than participants in the lowest quartile of height, OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.11, 4.14), after multivariate adjustment. Participants in the highest quartile of height were more likely to be diagnosed with high-grade prostate cancer than participants in the lowest quartile of height among participants who were black, OR 8.00 (95% CI 1.99, 32.18), and participants who had diabetes mellitus, OR 5.09 (95% CI 1.30, 19.98). CONCLUSIONS: Height is associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer overall and perhaps among certain subpopulations.","African Continental Ancestry Group
