21224058,Protein kinase C-theta is required for development of experimental cerebral malaria.,The American journal of pathology,Fauconnier M and Bourigault ML and Meme S and Szeremeta F and Palomo J and Danneels A and Charron S and Fick L and Jacobs M and Beloeil JC and Ryffel B and Quesniaux VF,Missing,"Cerebral malaria is the most severe neurologic complication in children and young adults infected with Plasmodium falciparum. T-cell activation is required for development of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-induced experimental cerebral malaria (CM). To characterize the T-cell activation pathway involved, the role of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta) in experimental CM development was examined. PKC-theta-deficient mice are resistant to CM development. In the absence of PKC-theta, no neurologic sign of CM developed after blood stage PbA infection. Resistance of PKC-theta-deficient mice correlated with unaltered cerebral microcirculation and absence of ischemia, as documented by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, whereas wild-type mice developed distinct microvascular pathology. Recruitment and activation of CD8(+) T cells, and ICAM-1 and CD69 expression were reduced in the brain of resistant mice; however, the pulmonary inflammation and edema associated with PbA infection were still present in the absence of functional PKC-theta. Resistant PKC-theta-deficient mice developed high parasitemia, and died at 3 weeks with severe anemia. Therefore, PKC-theta signaling is crucial for recruitment of CD8(+) T cells and development of brain microvascular pathology resulting in fatal experimental CM, and may represent a novel therapeutic target of CM.","Animals
