21705357,The management of myocarditis.,European heart journal,Schultheiss HP and Kuhl U and Cooper LT,Missing,"Despite considerable advances in our understanding of myocarditis pathogenesis, the clinical management of myocarditis has changed relatively little in the last few years. This review aims to help bridge the widening gap between recent mechanistic insights, which are largely derived from animal models, and their potential impact on disease burden. We illustrate the pathogenetic mechanisms that are prime targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Pathway and pathogen-specific molecular diagnostic tests have expanded the role for endomyocardial biopsy. State of the art cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can now provide non-invasive tissue characterization and localize inflammatory infiltrates but imaging techniques are misleading if infectious agents are involved. We emphasize the gaps in our current clinical knowledge, particularly with respect to aetiology-based therapy, and suggest opportunities for high impact, translational investigations.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use
