Our study in a large number of patients aimed to verify whether acromegaly patients carry a higher risk of harboring intracranial saccular aneurysms and to evaluate the possible relationship using clinical, laboratory, and imaging techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 152 of 161 consecutive acromegaly patients (median age, 55.7 yr; 82 females) underwent neuroimaging evaluation of the circle of Willis. Clinical data (disease duration and disease control, hypertension, smoking history, diabetes and dyslipidemia, previous surgery or radiotherapy, previous or current pharmacological therapy), laboratory findings (GH and IGF-I at onset and shortly before examination), and pituitary adenoma imaging features (size and invasiveness of the cavernous sinus) were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (17.3%) harbored 40 newly diagnosed intracranial aneurysms; two other patients had previously undergone aneurysm clipping due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ten patients had multiple aneurysms; most of the aneurysms were located in the intracranial tract of the internal carotid artery (67.5%); no aneurysms belonged to the vertebrobasilar circulation. The presence of intracranial aneurysms correlated with GH serum values at disease onset (P < 0.05) and showed a trend to a positive correlation with poor disease control (P = 0.06); no other laboratory, clinical, and radiological findings correlated with the presence of intracranial aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: GH serum excess seems to carry an increased risk of developing intracranial aneurysms. A neuroradiological evaluation of the intracranial circulation might therefore be considered in the diagnostic work-up of patients affected with acromegaly.","Acromegaly/complications/*epidemiology/pathology
