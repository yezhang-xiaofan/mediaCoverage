21698499,Teachers' perceptions regarding the management of children with autism spectrum disorders.,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,Syriopoulou-Delli CK and Cassimos DC and Tripsianis GI and Polychronopoulou SA,Missing,"This study examines Greek teachers' perceptions related to the nature and management of autistic children. To investigate these issues, a statistically reliable number of questionnaires (n = 228) was distributed to a diversified teacher population. The questionnaire responses were analyzed statistically to identify the explanatory power of critical independent variables. The research findings support that teachers' specialized training and working experience are critical inputs to improve teachers' perceptions and efficient serving of autistic children. A cumulative joint effect of teachers' previous specialized education and working experience working with autistic children was also indicated. This could be supportive of teachers upgrading their active leading role in team working with specialized scientific staff, parents and institutions on autistic children.","Child
