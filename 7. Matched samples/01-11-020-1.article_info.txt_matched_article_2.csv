Cementum regeneration is necessary for the proper repair of a periodontal ligament. The precise mechanism how bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) induces differentiation and mineralization of cementoblasts remains undetermined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of BMP7 on early proteome and gene expression profile of cementoblastic OCCM.30 cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immortalized murine cementoblasts (OCCM.30) were exposed to BMP7 and evaluated for: (1) proliferation; (2) mineralization; (3) early proteome profile using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS); and (4) gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Bone morphogenetic protein-7 increased the cell proliferation at 24 h and 48 h, while higher doses suppressed the cell proliferation at 48 h. BMP7 induced the mineralization of cementoblasts following 8 days of therapy. Using LC-MS we identified 1117 proteins from the cell lysate. Many belonged to extracellular matrix formation such as PCPE1, collagens, annexins and integrin receptors. RT-PCR analyses revealed a BMP7 dose-dependent upregulation of BMP1, TGFbeta1, osterix, osteoprotegerin, procollagen I and II, PCPE1, and noggin, while BMP6 and chordin expression were decreased. The high BMP7 dose down regulated most of the genes 24 h following therapy. CONCLUSION: Bone morphogenetic protein-7 promotes differentiation and mineralization of cementoblasts via inducing PCPE1 and BMP1 responsible for processing of type I collagen.","Animals
