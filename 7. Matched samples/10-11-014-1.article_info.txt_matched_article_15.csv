The production of these hormones is less segregated during development and during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards pancreatic lineages. We therefore sought to characterise the transcription factor profile of these cells that co-produce insulin and glucagon in the developing human pancreas, and thus to gain insight into their potential fate during normal pancreas development. METHODS: An immunohistochemical analysis was performed on human pancreas sections from fetal donors aged 9 to 21 weeks and from adult donors between the ages of 17 and 55 years. RESULTS: Endocrine cells were observed within the pancreas at all ages examined, with cells co-producing insulin and glucagon observed as early as 9 weeks of fetal age. The population of cells that co-produce insulin and glucagon generally decreased in prevalence with age, with negligible numbers in adult pancreas. From 9 to 16 weeks, the population of glucagon-only cells increased, while the insulin-only cells decreased in abundance. Cells that co-produced insulin and glucagon also produced the alpha cell transcription factor, aristaless related homeobox (ARX), and lacked the beta cell transcription factors pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1) and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue A (MAFA). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that cells co-producing insulin and glucagon in the developing human pancreas share a transcription factor profile that is similar to that of mature alpha cells and suggest that some maturing alpha cells briefly exhibit ectopic insulin expression. Thus cells that co-produce insulin and glucagon may represent a transient cell population, which gives rise to mature alpha cells.","Adolescent
