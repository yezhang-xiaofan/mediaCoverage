21336305,Klotho suppresses RIG-I-mediated senescence-associated inflammation.,Nature cell biology,Liu F and Wu S and Ren H and Gu J,Missing,"It is well known that aged or senescent cells develop a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is observed both in culture and in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of the SASP are largely unknown. We demonstrate that retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is induced through the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-interferon regulatory factor 1 (ATM-IRF1) axis in senescent cells and that RIG-I signalling mediates the expression of two important mediators of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Klotho has been associated with ageing. We show here that the intracellular, but not the secreted, form of klotho interacts with RIG-I and that this interaction inhibits RIG-I-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 both in vitro and in vivo. Our study uncovers a mechanism in which klotho functions as an anti-ageing factor through the suppression of RIG-I-mediated inflammation.","Animals
