21524327,The relationship between coping and subclinical psychotic experiences in adolescents from the general population--a longitudinal study.,Psychological medicine,Lin A and Wigman JT and Nelson B and Vollebergh WA and van Os J and Baksheev G and Ryan J and Raaijmakers QA and Thompson A and Yung AR,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Subclinical psychotic experiences during adolescence may represent liability for developing psychotic disorder. Both coping style and the degree of persistence of psychotic experiences may play a role in the progression to clinical psychotic disorder, but little is known about the causal relationship between the two. METHOD: Path modelling was used to examine longitudinal relationships between subclinical positive psychotic experiences and three styles of coping (task-, emotion- and avoidance-oriented) in an adolescent general population sample (n=813) assessed three times in 3 years. Distinct developmental trajectories of psychotic experiences, identified with growth mixture modelling, were compared on the use of these coping styles. RESULTS: Over time, emotion-oriented coping in general was bi-directionally related to psychotic experiences. No meaningful results were found for task- or avoidance-oriented coping. Females reported using a wider range of coping styles than males, but the paths between coping and psychotic experiences did not differ by gender. Persistence of psychotic experiences was associated with a greater use of emotion-oriented coping, whereas a decrease in experiences over time was associated with an increased use of task-orientated coping. CONCLUSIONS: Emotion-oriented coping is the most important coping style in relation to psychotic experiences, as it may contribute to a 'vicious cycle' and is associated with persistence of experiences. In addition, more task-oriented coping may result in a decrease in psychotic experiences. Results suggest that opportunities for intervention may already be present at the level of subclinical psychosis.","*Adaptation, Psychological
