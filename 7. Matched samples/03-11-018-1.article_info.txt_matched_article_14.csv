21681591,Parental perspectives of communication about sexuality in families of children with autism spectrum disorders.,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,Ballan MS,columbia,"To explore the content of communication about sexuality between parents and children with autism spectrum disorders, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 parents of children ages 6-13. Content analysis and ethnographic summary were used to interpret the data. Findings suggest that parent's perceptions of a child's behaviors and comprehension are associated with the likelihood that communication occurs. However, parents recognize the risks their children experience, with the greatest fears being sexual victimization and misperceptions related to the intent of their child's behaviors. This study provides information on the nature of communication about sexuality in families of children with autism spectrum disorders and can help tailor interventions aimed at assisting parents to communicate sexuality information effectively.","Adolescent
