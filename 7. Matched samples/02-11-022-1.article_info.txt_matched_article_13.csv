OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish how well the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and population-specific cutoffs for childhood BMI predict CVD risk factors in midadulthood. DESIGN: We used the 1958 British birth cohort, whose BMI measures were collected at 7, 11, and 16 y and whose CVD risk factors (obesity, hypertension, adverse lipid concentrations, and type 2 diabetes risk) were collected at 45 y. The sensitivity and specificity of IOTF and population-specific cutoffs for childhood BMI were calculated for each CVD risk factor. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight or obesity was low in childhood (<11%, IOTF cutoffs) compared with that in adulthood (75% men, 56% women). The IOTF cutoffs had high specificities (91.6-97.9%) but low sensitivities (7.1-31.5%) for predicting adult outcomes. In comparison, population-specific cutoffs identified large groups of children (eg, >38% for predicting adult obesity) who had improved sensitivities (17.3-67.3%) but lower specificities (52.9-84.6%) compared with IOTF cutoffs. Accelerated BMI gains in childhood predicted adult obesity and type 2 diabetes risk, but prediction was no greater than that for childhood BMI at one age (area under the curve: 0.55-0.65 compared with 0.59-0.75). Childhood BMI and BMI gain were weak predictors of adult hypertension and adverse lipid concentrations. CONCLUSION: Neither the IOTF cutoffs nor our population-specific cutoffs for childhood BMI are adequate diagnostic tools for adult CVD risk factors in a population experiencing rapid changes in obesity prevalence over their lifetime.","Adolescent
