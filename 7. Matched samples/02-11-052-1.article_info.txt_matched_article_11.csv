22043004,"Gipr is essential for adrenocortical steroidogenesis; however, corticosterone deficiency does not mediate the favorable metabolic phenotype of Gipr(-/-) mice.",Diabetes,Bates HE and Campbell JE and Ussher JR and Baggio LL and Maida A and Seino Y and Drucker DJ,Missing,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) promotes glucose-dependent insulin secretion. However, GIP also enhances glucocorticoid secretion and promotes adiposity. Because obesity and diabetes are glucocorticoid dependent, we examined whether the effects of GIP on energy balance and glycemia are regulated by glucocorticoids using pharmacological activation of GIP receptor (GIPR) signaling with [d-Ala(2)]GIP in mice and in Y1 adrenocortical cells. Genetic elimination of GIPR activity was also studied in normal- and high-fat (HF)-fed Gipr-deficient (Gipr(-/-)) mice. [d-Ala(2)]GIP increased murine corticosterone levels in a GIPR-dependent manner. Conversely, basal corticosterone levels were reduced, whereas food deprivation resulted in significantly enhanced plasma corticosterone levels in Gipr(-/-) mice. [d-Ala(2)]GIP increased cAMP levels, activated extracellular signal\x{2013}related kinase (ERK)1/2, increased expression of steroidogenic genes, and increased neutral lipid storage in Y1GIPR cells. Gipr(-/-) adrenal glands demonstrated a twofold upregulation of the ACTH receptor mRNA and increased sensitivity to ACTH ex vivo. Although HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice exhibited significantly lower plasma corticosterone, glucocorticoid-treated HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice had similar energy balance and glycemia compared with Gipr(+)(/+) controls. Hence, although the Gipr is essential for adrenal steroidogenesis and links HF feeding to increased levels of corticosterone, reduced glucocorticoid levels do not significantly contribute to the enhanced metabolic phenotypes in HF-fed Gipr(-/-) mice.","Adrenal Cortex/drug effects/metabolism
