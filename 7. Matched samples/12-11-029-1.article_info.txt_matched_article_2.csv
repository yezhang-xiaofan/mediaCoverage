This study was designed to investigate the effects of the polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C-->T (MTHFR 677 C-->T), thymidylate synthase (TYMS 3R-->2R),and methionine synthase 2756 A-->G (MTR 2756 A-->G) on the risk of lung cancer and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted a case-control study involving 438 NSCLC cases (including 101 follow-up cases) and 641 healthy controls in North China. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Using a genetic model analysis, the polymorphism MTHFR 677 C-->T showed a significantly increased risk for NSCLC in women but not in men, which was observed in the codominant model (CT vs CC adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-4.42; p = 0.003; TT vs CC adjusted OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.09-3.81; p = 0.03) and the dominant model (CT + TT vs CC adjusted OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.31-4.05; p = 0.004). In addition, we found that patients with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype showed a better response to platinum-based chemotherapy in the recessive model (TT vs CT + CC adjusted OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.09-0.68; p = 0.007), the generalized OR was 0.44 (0.22-0.88; p = 0.04). There were no significant associations of the polymorphisms of TYMS 3R-->2R or MTR 2756 A-->G with the risk of NSCLC or response to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC in any genetic model. Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR 677 C-->T may contribute to NSCLC development in Chinese women and could also influence treatment response for advanced NSCLC patients with platinum-based chemotherapy. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate this association.","5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism
