21593041,Efficacy of apolipoprotein B synthesis inhibition in subjects with mild-to-moderate hyperlipidaemia.,European heart journal,Akdim F and Tribble DL and Flaim JD and Yu R and Su J and Geary RS and Baker BF and Fuhr R and Wedel MK and Kastelein JJ,Missing,"AIMS: Mipomersen, an apolipoprotein (apo) B synthesis inhibitor, has been shown to produce potent reductions in apoB and LDL-cholesterol levels in animal models as well as healthy human volunteers. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mipomersen monotherapy with or without dose loading in subjects with mild-to-moderate hyperlipidaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty subjects with LDL-cholesterol levels between 119 and 266 mg/dL were enrolled into five cohorts at a 4:1 randomization ratio of active to placebo. Two 13-week dose regimens were evaluated at doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/week. Mipomersen produced dose-dependent reductions in all apoB containing lipoproteins. In the 200 and 300 mg/week dose cohorts, mean reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol were -45 +/- 10% (P= 0.000) and -61 +/- 8% (P= 0.000), corresponding to a -46 +/- 11% (P= 0.000) and -61 +/- 7% (P= 0.000) decrease in apoB levels. Triglyceride levels were also lowered with median reductions up to 53% (P= 0.021). The most common adverse events were injection site reactions. Seven of 40 subjects (18%) showed consecutive transaminase elevations >3x upper limit of normal. Five of these subjects received 400 mg/week, four of whom had apoB levels below the limit of detection. As a consequence, the 400 mg/week cohort was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Mipomersen administered as monotherapy in subjects with mild-to-moderate hyperlipidaemia produced potent reductions in all apoB-containing lipoproteins. Higher doses were associated with hepatic transaminase increases.","Adolescent
