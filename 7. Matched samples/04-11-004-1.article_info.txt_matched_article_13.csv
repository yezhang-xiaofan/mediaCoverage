20847078,Increased upper airway cytokines and oxidative stress in severe obstructive sleep apnoea.,The European respiratory journal,Kimoff RJ and Hamid Q and Divangahi M and Hussain S and Bao W and Naor N and Payne RJ and Ariyarajah A and Mulrain K and Petrof BJ,Missing,"Inflammation may contribute to upper airway pathophysiology in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Our objective was to compare upper airway pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, oxidative stress and connective tissue deposition in severe (n = 25) versus mild (n = 17) OSA patients. Upper airway surgical specimens were separated by predominance of either mucosal or muscle tissue. Expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, interferon-gamma, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and l-selectin were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. Oxidative stress was assessed via protein carbonyl group detection by immunoblotting. Histochemistry was employed for immunolocalisation of selected cytokines and connective tissue morphometry. In the severe OSA group, expression of IL-1alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta was significantly higher in mucosa-predominant tissues, whereas in muscle-predominant specimens, RANTES expression was greater in severe OSA. Increased protein carbonylation was observed in severe OSA within both mucosal and muscle compartments. Immunohistochemistry localised TGF-beta to submucosal and perimuscular inflammatory cells, while IL-6 was primarily localised to myocytes. Consistent with the pro-fibrotic cytokine profile observed in mucosa-predominant tissue, morphometric analysis revealed greater submucosal and perimuscular connective tissue in severe OSA subjects. There is increased pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine expression, oxidative stress, and connective tissue deposition in upper airway tissues from severe versus mild OSA patients.","Adult
