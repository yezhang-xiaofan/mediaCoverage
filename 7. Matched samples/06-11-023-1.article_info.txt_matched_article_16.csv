21909839,Genetic variants at CDC123/CAMK1D and SPRY2 are associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.,Diabetologia,Imamura M and Iwata M and Maegawa H and Watada H and Hirose H and Tanaka Y and Tobe K and Kaku K and Kashiwagi A and Kawamori R and Nakamura Y and Maeda S,Missing,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recently, rs10906115 in CDC123/CAMK1D, rs1359790 near SPRY2, rs1436955 in C2CD4A/C2CD4B and rs10751301 in ODZ4 were identified as genetic risk variants for type 2 diabetes by a genome-wide association study in a Chinese population. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the role of these four variants in conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population. METHODS: We genotyped 11,530 Japanese individuals (8,552 type 2 diabetes cases, 2,978 controls) for the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used logistic regression analysis to determine whether they were associated with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: In accordance with the findings in a Chinese population, rs10906115 A, rs1359790 C and rs1436955 G were found to be risk alleles. Both rs10906115 and rs1359790 were significantly associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in our study (rs10906115 OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08, 1.22; p = 6.10 x 10(-6); rs1359790 OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.21; p = 2.24 x 10(-4)). Adjustment for age, sex and BMI had no significant effects on the association between these variants and the disease. We did not observe any significant associations between the SNPs and any metabolic traits, e.g. BMI, fasting plasma glucose (determined for 1,332 controls), HOMA of beta cell function (900 controls) and HOMA of insulin resistance (900 controls; p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The SNPs rs10906115 A and rs1359790 C are significantly associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population, confirming that these alleles are common susceptibility variants for type 2 diabetes in East Asian populations.","Adult
