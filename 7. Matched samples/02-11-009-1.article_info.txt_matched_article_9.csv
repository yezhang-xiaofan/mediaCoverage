20597459,The positive role of social networks and social networking technology in the condom-using behaviors of homeless young people.,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",Rice E,usc,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of condom-using peers in the social networks of homeless young people, differences in behaviors were assessed based on the social location of ties (home-based vs. street-based) and how those ties are maintained (face-to-face vs. via social networking technology). METHODS: ""Ego-centric"" social network data were collected from 103 currently sexually active homeless young people aged 16-26 years in Los Angeles, California. Associations between condom use and the condom-using behaviors of social network influences were assessed using standard logistic regression. RESULTS: About 52% of respondents had a street-based peer who was a condom user. Having such a peer was associated with a 70% reduction in the odds of having unprotected sex at last intercourse. About 22% of respondents had a condom-using, home-based peer with whom they communicated only via social networking technology. Having such a peer was associated with a 90% reduction in risky sexual behavior and a 3.5 times increase in safer sex behavior. CONCLUSION: The study revealed several implications for new human immunodeficiency virus-prevention interventions that mobilize these networks and social networking technologies.","Adolescent
