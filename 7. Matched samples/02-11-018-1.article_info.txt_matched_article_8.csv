21325457,Contributions of cardiorespiratory fitness and visceral adiposity to six-year changes in cardiometabolic risk markers in apparently healthy men and women.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Rheaume C and Arsenault BJ and Dumas MP and Perusse L and Tremblay A and Bouchard C and Poirier P and Despres JP,Missing,"CONTEXT: Both excess visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels are associated with a deteriorated cardiometabolic risk profile. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the respective contributions of changes in VAT accumulation vs. changes in CRF to 6-yr longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic risk markers. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a prospective, population-based study with an average follow-up of 5.9 +/- 0.8 yr. We followed 132 middle-aged participants from the Quebec Family Study (mean age, 35.3 +/- 13.9 yr). VAT was measured by computed tomography, whereas the level of CRF was assessed by a submaximal physical working capacity test at baseline and at follow-up. A complete cardiometabolic risk profile, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin levels, C-reactive protein (n = 72), as well as a standard lipoprotein-lipid profile, was obtained at baseline and at follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured changes in CRF, VAT, and cardiometabolic risk profile over 6 yr. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and sex, 6-yr changes in VAT were negatively correlated with changes in CRF (r = -0.38; P < 0.001). In a multivariate model that included age, sex, changes in VAT, changes in CRF, as well as baseline levels of the above cardiometabolic risk factors, 6-yr changes in VAT were the most important predictor of the change in the metabolic syndrome score (R(2) = 13.2%; P < 0.001). Adding 6-yr changes in CRF levels significantly improved the predictability of the model (R(2) = 19.7%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in both VAT and CRF levels observed over 6 yr are associated with changes in parameters of the lipoprotein-lipid profile, glucose-insulin homeostasis, and inflammatory markers. Thus, maintaining a low level of VAT and a high level of CRF are important targets for maintenance of cardiometabolic health.","Adiposity/*physiology
