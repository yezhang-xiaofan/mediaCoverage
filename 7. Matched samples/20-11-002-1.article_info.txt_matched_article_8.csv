21123448,Insulin receptor isoforms and insulin-like growth factor receptor in human follicular cell precursors from papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Malaguarnera R and Frasca F and Garozzo A and Giani F and Pandini G and Vella V and Vigneri R and Belfiore A,Missing,"CONTEXT: Factors involved in the biology of normal and cancer stem/precursor cells from the thyroid are unknown. Thyroid cancer cells are responsive to insulin and IGF-I and IGF-II and often overexpress the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of IR isoforms (IR-A and IR-B), IGF-IR, and their ligands in thyroid follicular cell precursors both normal and malignant. DESIGN: We established cultures of follicular cell precursors as thyrospheres from three papillary thyroid cancers and the corresponding nonaffected tissues. The expression of IR, IGF-IR, and their ligands was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and, in one case, also by Western blot. The effects of insulin and IGFs on thyrosphere growth and self-renewal were evaluated. RESULTS: Thyrospheres were characterized by the expression of stem cell markers and low/absent thyroid specific markers. Thyrospheres from normal tissue, but not from cancer tissue, could be induced to differentiate. Both IR isoforms, IGF-IR, IGF-I and IGF-II, were expressed at high levels in thyrospheres and markedly decreased in differentiating cells. IR-A was the predominant isoform in thyrospheres, especially from cancer, while IR-B was predominant in differentiating cells. Cancer thyrosphere growth was stimulated by insulin and IGFs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that IR isoforms and IGF-IR play a role in the biology of follicular thyroid precursors. Cell differentiation is associated with marked changes in the expression of these receptors and cognate ligands. These data may provide insight for future differentiation therapies in thyroid cancer.","Blotting, Western
