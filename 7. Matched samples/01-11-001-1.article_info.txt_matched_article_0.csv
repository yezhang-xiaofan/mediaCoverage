21299316,Grouping information for judgments.,Journal of experimental psychology. General,Shah AK and Oppenheimer DM,princeton,"Models of cue weighting in judgment have typically focused on how decision-makers weight cues individually. Here, the authors propose that people might recognize and weight groups of cues. They examine how judgments change when decision-makers focus on cues individually or as parts of groups. Several experiments demonstrate that people can spontaneously pack information into cue groups. Moreover, group-level weighting depends on how people assess similarity or how they think of categorical hierarchies.","AdultAnalysis of Variance*CuesDecision Making/physiologyFemaleHumansJudgment/*physiologyMale"
