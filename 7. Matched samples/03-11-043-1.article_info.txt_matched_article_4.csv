22235892,"Do lions have manes? For children, generics are about kinds rather than quantities.",Child development,Brandone AC and Cimpian A and Leslie SJ and Gelman SA,lehigh,"Generic statements (e.g., ""Lions have manes"") make claims about kinds (e.g., lions as a category) and, for adults, are distinct from quantificational statements (e.g., ""Most lions have manes""), which make claims about how many individuals have a given property. This article examined whether young children also understand that generics do not depend purely on quantitative information. Five-year-olds (n = 36) evaluated pairs of questions expressing properties that were matched in prevalence but varied in whether adults accept them as generically true (e.g., ""Do lions have manes?"" [true] vs. ""Are lions boys?"" [false]). Results demonstrated that children evaluate generics based on more than just quantitative information. Data suggest that even young children recognize that generics make claims about kinds.","Age Factors
