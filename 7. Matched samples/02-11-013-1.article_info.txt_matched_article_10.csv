METHODS: In a nested case-control study comparing 746 lung cancer cases to 1,477 controls, all of whom were non-Hispanic white smokers in the beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial, we examined whether lung cancer risk is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the AGPHD1, CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 genes and whether such risk is modified by diet and other characteristics. Intake of fruits and vegetables, their botanical groups, and specific nutrients were ascertained generally at baseline by food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Several sets of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium were found: one set associated with a 27-34% increase and two sets associated with a 13-19% decrease in risk per minor allele. Associations were most prominent for the set including the non-synonymous SNP rs16969968. The rs16969968-lung cancer association did not differ by intake level of most dietary factors examined, but was stronger for individuals diagnosed at < 70 years of age or having a baseline smoking history of <40 cigarette pack-years. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that diet has little influence on the relation between chromosome 15q24-25.1 variation and lung cancer risk.","Adenocarcinoma/genetics
