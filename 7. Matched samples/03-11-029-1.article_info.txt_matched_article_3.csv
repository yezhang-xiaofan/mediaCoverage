21903199,Association of somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction: insights from the translational research investigating underlying disparities in acute myocardial infarction patients' health status registry.,Biological psychiatry,Smolderen KG and Spertus JA and Reid KJ and Buchanan DM and Vaccarino V and Lichtman JH and Bekelman DB and Chan PS,Missing,"BACKGROUND: Somatic depressive symptoms and certain biomarkers are each associated with worse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prognosis, but the relationship between depressive symptom domains and inflammatory, neurohormonal, and coagulation markers is unknown. METHODS: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B(per SD increase) = .02, 95% confidence interval: .00; .05, p = .07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B(per SD increase) = .28, 95% confidence interval: .12; .44, p < .001). Cognitive depressive symptoms were not associated with hs-CRP or WBC count. Neither dimension was associated with NT-proBNP or platelet levels. For each biomarker, the depression dimensions explained <1% of their variation. CONCLUSIONS: Neither somatic nor cognitive depressive symptoms were meaningfully associated with hs-CRP, NT-proBNP, WBC, or platelet counts 1 month after AMI, suggesting that the association between depression and long-term outcomes may be unrelated to these biomarkers. Future research should explore other biomarkers to better illuminate pathways by which depression adversely impacts AMI prognosis.","Acute Disease
