22031518,High-dose insulin therapy reduces postoperative liver dysfunction and complications in liver resection patients through reduced apoptosis and altered inflammation.,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Fisette A and Hassanain M and Metrakos P and Doi SA and Salman A and Schricker T and Lattermann R and Wykes L and Nitschmann E and Smith J and Cianflone K,Missing,"CONTEXT: An exaggerated inflammatory response in patients undergoing major liver resection coupled with poor nutrition diminishes liver regenerative capacity and increases the risk of postoperative complications. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate the biological context leading to better clinical outcomes in patients undergoing liver resection coupled with hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp vs. standard care (insulin sliding care). DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was a fundamental research analysis of a patient subset from a randomized-controlled study at the McGill University Health Center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Thirty consenting patients participating in a randomized clinical trial for liver resection received either hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp technique with 24-h preoperative carbohydrate load (intervention) or standard glucose control through insulin sliding scale treatment (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Liver biopsies and plasma samples were taken at various time points before and after surgery. Primary measures included mRNA quantitation for genes related to insulin signaling, inflammation, and proliferation; proinflammatory cytokines at various time points; and liver function markers. These measurements were associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp technique reduced postoperative liver dysfunction, infections, and complications. Markers of energy stores indicated higher substrate availability. Cytokine expression pattern was altered (TNF-alpha, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein). Apoptosis was markedly reduced, whereas the complement system was unaltered. CONCLUSION: The hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp technique reduced postoperative negative outcomes by suppressing apoptosis. This phenomenon appears to be linked with higher substrate availability and altered cytokine secretion profile and may provide a long-term benefit of this therapy on liver resection patients.","Aged
