21909837,An increased frequency of NK cell receptor and HLA-C group 1 combinations in early-onset type 1 diabetes.,Diabetologia,Mehers KL and Long AE and van der Slik AR and Aitken RJ and Nathwani V and Wong FS and Bain S and Gill G and Roep BO and Bingley PJ and Gillespie KM,Missing,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Natural killer (NK) cells serve as primary immune surveillance and are partially regulated by combinations of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and their HLA class I ligands. Alterations in NK cell activity have been associated with type 1 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether KIR-HLA class I gene frequency: (1) is altered in a current population with type 1 diabetes compared with healthy controls; and (2) has changed over the half century in which the incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased rapidly. METHODS: KIR-HLA class I gene frequencies were compared in 551 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes </= 15 years of age (394 in a current cohort and 157 from the historical 'Golden Years' cohort) and 168 healthy controls. The overall balance of activation and inhibition was analysed using KIR-HLA genotype models. RESULTS: Children with type 1 diabetes who were positive for KIR2DS2/KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 were more often homozygous for HLA-C group 1 and this effect was strongest in children diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 5 years (p = 0.003, corrected p [p (corr)] = 0.012) and (p = 0.001, p (corr) = 0.004), respectively. Children with type 1 diabetes have fewer inhibitory KIRs with their corresponding ligands compared with healthy controls (p = 1.9 x 10(-4)). This pattern of NK activation has not changed significantly in individuals with type 1 diabetes over the last half century. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Activating combinations of KIR-HLA genes are more frequent in young children with type 1 diabetes diagnosed in the first 5 years of life, suggesting that NK cell responses may be altered in this group.","Adolescent
