21641386,beta-cell loss and beta-cell apoptosis in human type 2 diabetes are related to islet amyloid deposition.,The American journal of pathology,Jurgens CA and Toukatly MN and Fligner CL and Udayasankar J and Subramanian SL and Zraika S and Aston-Mourney K and Carr DB and Westermark P and Westermark GT and Kahn SE and Hull RL,Missing,"Amyloid deposition and reduced beta-cell mass are pathological hallmarks of the pancreatic islet in type 2 diabetes; however, whether the extent of amyloid deposition is associated with decreased beta-cell mass is debated. We investigated the possible relationship and, for the first time, determined whether increased islet amyloid and/or decreased beta-cell area quantified on histological sections is correlated with increased beta-cell apoptosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human pancreas sections from subjects with (n = 29) and without (n = 39) diabetes were obtained at autopsy (64 +/- 2 and 70 +/- 4 islets/subject, respectively). Amyloid and beta cells were visualized by thioflavin S and insulin immunolabeling. Apoptotic beta cells were detected by colabeling for insulin and by TUNEL. Diabetes was associated with increased amyloid deposition, decreased beta-cell area, and increased beta-cell apoptosis, as expected. There was a strong inverse correlation between beta-cell area and amyloid deposition (r = -0.42, P < 0.001). beta-Cell area was selectively reduced in individual amyloid-containing islets from diabetic subjects, compared with control subjects, but amyloid-free islets had beta-cell area equivalent to islets from control subjects. Increased amyloid deposition was associated with beta-cell apoptosis (r = 0.56, P < 0.01). Thus, islet amyloid is associated with decreased beta-cell area and increased beta-cell apoptosis, suggesting that islet amyloid deposition contributes to the decreased beta-cell mass that characterizes type 2 diabetes.","Adult
