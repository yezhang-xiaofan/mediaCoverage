21444924,Glucose- and hormone-induced cAMP oscillations in alpha- and beta-cells within intact pancreatic islets.,Diabetes,Tian G and Sandler S and Gylfe E and Tengholm A,Missing,"OBJECTIVE: cAMP is a critical messenger for insulin and glucagon secretion from pancreatic beta- and alpha-cells, respectively. Dispersed beta-cells show cAMP oscillations, but the signaling kinetics in cells within intact islets of Langerhans is unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subplasma-membrane cAMP concentration ([cAMP](pm)) was recorded in alpha- and beta-cells in the mantle of intact mouse pancreatic islets using total internal reflection microscopy and a fluorescent translocation biosensor. Cell identification was based on the opposite effects of adrenaline on cAMP in alpha- and beta-cells. RESULTS: In islets exposed to 3 mmol/L glucose, [cAMP](pm) was low and stable. Glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)-amide (GLP-1) induced dose-dependent elevation of [cAMP](pm), often with oscillations synchronized among beta-cells. Whereas glucagon also induced [cAMP](pm) oscillations in most alpha-cells, <20% of the alpha-cells responded to GLP-1. Elevation of the glucose concentration to 11-30 mmol/L in the absence of hormones induced slow [cAMP](pm) oscillations in both alpha- and beta-cells. These cAMP oscillations were coordinated with those of the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the beta-cells but not caused by the changes in [Ca(2+)](i). The transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine suppressed the glucose- and hormone-induced [cAMP](pm) elevations, whereas the preferential inhibitors of soluble AC, KH7, and 1,3,5(10)-estratrien-2,3,17-beta-triol perturbed cell metabolism and lacked effect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory [cAMP](pm) signaling in secretagogue-stimulated beta-cells is maintained within intact islets and depends on transmembrane AC activity. The discovery of glucose- and glucagon-induced [cAMP](pm) oscillations in alpha-cells indicates the involvement of cAMP in the regulation of pulsatile glucagon secretion.","Adenylate Cyclase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism
