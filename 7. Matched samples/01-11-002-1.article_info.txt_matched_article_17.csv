21554946,"Trait anger, cynical hostility and inflammation in Latinas: variations by anger type?","Brain, behavior, and immunity",Shivpuri S and Gallo LC and Mills PJ and Matthews KA and Elder JP and Talavera GA,sdsu,"Anger and hostility are psychological factors that appear to play a salient role in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, their association with risk within the Latino population remains relatively unexplored. The current study examined associations between overall trait anger, anger subdimensions (i.e., anger temperament and anger reaction) and cynical hostility with sICAM-1, a marker of cellular adhesion and systemic inflammation related to CVD risk, in a sample of 294 middleaged Mexican-American women. Results showed no association between trait anger or anger temperament and sICAM-1. Anger reaction was marginally associated with sICAM-1 (beta=4.77, p=.06). Cynical hostility was significantly associated with sICAM-1 (beta=5.89, p=.04) even after controlling for demographic, biological and behavioral covariates. The current study provides evidence that specific aspects of anger and hostility relate to physiological pathways that potentially influence CVD risk. Findings are discussed in light of contextual cultural factors.","Adult
