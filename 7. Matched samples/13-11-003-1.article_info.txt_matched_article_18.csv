21183050,Interactions of monensin with dietary fat and carbohydrate components on ruminal fermentation and production responses by dairy cows.,Journal of dairy science,Mathew B and Eastridge ML and Oelker ER and Firkins JL and Karnati SK,Missing,"Variation in milk fat percentage resulting from monensin supplementation to lactating dairy cows could be due to altered ruminal fermentation with interactions of monensin with ruminal biohydrogenation of fat and ruminal carbohydrate availability. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of feeding monensin as Rumensin (R) in diets differing in starch availability (ground or steam-flaked corn), effective fiber (long or short alfalfa hay, LAH or SAH), and 4% fat (F) from distillers grains, roasted soybeans, and an animal-vegetable blend on ruminal fermentation characteristics and milk production in lactating dairy cows. Six ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a balanced 6x6 Latin square design with 21-d periods. The cows were fed 6 diets: (1) C=control diet with ground corn and LAH, (2) CR=C plus R, (3) CRFL=CR plus F, (4) CRFS=ground corn, R, F, and SAH, (5) SRFL=steam-flaked corn, R, F, and LAH, and (6) SRFS=steam-flaked corn, R, F, and SAH. Mean particle size of LAH was 5.00 mm and 1.36 mm for SAH. All diets were formulated to have 21% forage NDF and 40% NFC. The R tended to decrease DMI, decreased milk fat yield, and numerically lowered milk fat percentage (3.41 vs. 2.98%). Addition of F to R diets did not affect milk fat percentage. By feeding diets containing R and F, SAH tended to increase milk fat percentage for the ground-corn diet, but SAH tended to decrease milk fat percentage with steam-flaked corn (CRFL+SRFS vs. CRFS+SRFL). The steam-flaked corn increased total-tract NDF digestibility (CRFL + CRFS vs. SRFL+SRFS; 51.1 vs. 56%). Addition of F with R decreased total VFA concentration and increased rumen pH. Fat addition with R decreased rumen NH3N and MUN (12.8 vs. 13.9 mg/dL), and SFC decreased NH3N concentration compared with ground corn. Although R caused milk fat depression, addition of F did not further exacerbate milk fat depression. Fatty acid analysis did not implicate any particular biohydrogenation intermediate as the causative factor for the milk fat depression.","Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena
