21336303,A non-genetic route to aneuploidy in human cancers.,Nature cell biology,Krajcovic M and Johnson NB and Sun Q and Normand G and Hoover N and Yao E and Richardson AL and King RW and Cibas ES and Schnitt SJ and Brugge JS and Overholtzer M,Missing,"Aneuploidy is common in human tumours and is often indicative of aggressive disease. Aneuploidy can result from cytokinesis failure, which produces binucleate cells that generate aneuploid offspring with subsequent divisions. In cancers, disruption of cytokinesis is known to result from genetic perturbations to mitotic pathways or checkpoints. Here we describe a non-genetic mechanism of cytokinesis failure that occurs as a direct result of cell-in-cell formation by entosis. Live cells internalized by entosis, which can persist through the cell cycle of host cells, disrupt formation of the contractile ring during host cell division. As a result, cytokinesis frequently fails, generating binucleate cells that produce aneuploid cell lineages. In human breast tumours, multinucleation is associated with cell-in-cell structures. These data define a previously unknown mechanism of cytokinesis failure and aneuploid cell formation that operates in human cancers.","*Aneuploidy
