21799252,Activation of glutathione peroxidase and inhibition of p53-related apoptosis by apomorphine.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Ma L and Ohyagi Y and Nakamura N and Iinuma KM and Miyoshi K and Himeno E and Soejima N and Yanagihara YT and Sakae N and Yamasaki R and Kira J,Missing,"Apomorphine hydrochloride (APO) is known to be a dopamine receptor agonist, and has recently been found to be a novel drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that APO treatment ameliorated oxidative stress in an AD mouse model and specifically attenuated the hydrogen peroxide-induced p53-related apoptosis in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. To further understand the mechanism behind this action, we investigated the actions of APO on intracellular redox systems, such as the glutathione cycle and catalase. We studied the effects of specific inhibitors for glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (BCNU, MCS, and ATZ, respectively) on the effects of APO. Treatments with MCS or BCNU, but not ATZ, significantly attenuated the protective effects of APO. Interestingly, APO treatment elevated GPx activity, but did not increase the expression of the GPx1 protein. Although BCNU treatment attenuated APO effects, GR activity was not elevated by APO treatment. The same effects were observed in primary neuronal cultures. In addition, treatment with dopamine D1, D2, D3 and D4 receptor antagonists did not counteract the protective action of APO. Thus, APO may enhance GPx activity through dopamine receptor-independent pathways.","Apomorphine/*pharmacology
