21768098,Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) mediates a protective response in cancer cells treated with inhibitors of fatty acid synthase.,The Journal of biological chemistry,Lemmon CR and Woo JH and Tully E and Wilsbach K and Gabrielson E,Missing,"The efficacy of drugs used to treat cancer can be significantly attenuated by adaptive responses of neoplastic cells to drug-induced stress. To determine how cancer cells respond to inhibition of the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS), we focused on NF-kappaB-mediated pathways, which can be activated by various cellular stresses. Treating lung cancer cells with C93, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS, results in changes indicative of a rapid initiation of NF-kappaB signaling, including translocation of RelA/p65 NF-kappaB to the nucleus, activation of a transfected NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter, and increased expression of NF-kappaB-dependent transcripts, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2. Verifying that these responses to C93 are specifically related to inhibition of FAS, we confirmed that levels of these same transcripts increase in response to siRNA targeting FAS. Inhibiting this NF-kappaB response (either by transfecting a mutant IkappaBalpha or treating with bortezomib) resulted in increased cell killing by C93, indicating that the NF-kappaB response is protective in this setting. Because inhibiting FAS leads to accumulation of intermediate metabolites of fatty acid biosynthesis, we then questioned whether protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in this response to metabolic stress. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that C93 treatment results in cellular translocation of PKCalpha and PKCbeta isoforms and increased PKCalpha-dependent phosphorylation of the IkappaBalpha subunit of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, inhibiting PKC activity with RO-31-8220 or PKCalpha isoform-specific siRNA attenuates C93-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation and also potentiates C93-induced cell killing. These results suggest a link between PKC and NF-kappaB in protecting cancer cells from metabolic stress induced by inhibiting FAS.","Cell Line, Tumor
