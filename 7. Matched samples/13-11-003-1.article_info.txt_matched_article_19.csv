21183031,Alternative programs to presynchronize estrous cycles in dairy cattle before a timed artificial insemination program.,Journal of dairy science,Stevenson JS,k-state,"The objective was to test potential presynchronization programs applied to cows before a timed artificial insemination (TAI) program to increase the percentage of cows ovulating in response to both GnRH injections of a TAI program and having a functional corpus luteum before the first GnRH injection of the TAI program. At calving, cows were blocked by lactation (1 vs. 2+) and assigned randomly to receive 1 of 5 presynchronization treatments. Two variants of the standard Presynch program were tested in which 2 injections of PGF2alpha were administered 14 d apart with either 14 d (Pre14; n=122), 12 d (Pre12; n=123), or 10 d (Pre10; n=151) intervening before a TAI program was initiated. Two other presynchronization programs consisted of administering a progesterone-releasing controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert for 7 d plus PGF2alpha administration at insert removal. Insert removal occurred either 10 d (CIDR10; n=157) or 3 d (CIDR3; n=117) before a TAI program was initiated. The TAI program was a standard Cosynch program [injection of GnRH 7 d before (GnRH-1) and 72 h after (GnRH-2) PGF2alpha with TAI administered 72 h after PGF2alpha]. Cosynch served as the control (n=157), and cows were assumed to be starting this program at random stages of the estrous cycle. From a subset of cows per treatment (ranging from 49 to 51 cows each), blood samples were collected from coccygeal vessels by using evacuated tubes at d -28, -14, 0 (onset of TAI program), 7, 9, 14, and 21. Ovarian scans were conducted on d 0, 7, 9, 14, and 21 by transrectal ultrasonography. Diameters of follicles and corpus luteum were measured at each exam, and ovulation was determined on d 7 (response to GnRH-1 on d 0) and d 14 (response to GnRH-2 on d 10). Ovulatory incidence after GnRH-1 (47.1 to 67.3%) and GnRH-2 (78 to 90.2%) varied but did not differ among treatments. Before GnRH-1, progesterone concentrations were less in the CIDR3 treatment than in all other treatments. Before GnRH-2, progesterone was greater in the CIDR3 treatment than in all other treatments. Luteal regression and synchronization rate (successful luteolysis and ovulation after GnRH-2) did not differ among treatments. Pregnancy rate per AI at 32 and 60 d post TAI was less in CIDR3 cows than in cows in all other treatments. None of the Presynch treatments improved key responses (ovulation, luteolysis, and synchronization rate) known to improve fertility compared with a standard Cosynch program without presynchronization.","Animals
