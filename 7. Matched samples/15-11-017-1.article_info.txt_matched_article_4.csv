Levels of sFlt-1 protein were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the vitreous of four out of five AAV2.sFlt-1-injected eyes. There was no evidence of damage to the eyes of animals that received subretinal injections of AAV2.sFlt-1; ocular examination showed no anterior chamber flare, normal fundus and electroretinography responses equivalent to those observed before treatment. Notably, immunological analysis demonstrated that gene therapy involving subretinal injection of AAV2.sFlt-1 does not elicit cell-mediated immunity. Biodistribution analysis showed that AAV2.sFlt-1 could be detected only in the eye and not in the other organs tested. These data indicate that gene therapy with subretinal AAV2.sFlt-1 is safe and well tolerated, and therefore promising for the long-term treatment of neovascular diseases of the eye.","Animals
