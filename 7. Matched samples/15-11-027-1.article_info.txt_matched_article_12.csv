21750376,Amyloid-beta peptide-induced secretion of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone glycoprotein GRP94.,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Viana RJ and Steer CJ and Rodrigues CM,Missing,"Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide-induced neurotoxicity is typically associated with cell death through mechanisms not entirely understood. Here, we investigated stress signaling events triggered by soluble Abeta in differentiated rat neuronal-like PC12 cells. Morphologic evaluation of apoptosis confirmed that Abeta induced nuclear fragmentation that was prevented by pre-treatment with the antiapoptotic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). In addition, Abeta exposure triggered an early signaling response by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and caspase-12-mediated apoptosis, which, however, was independent of the ER-stress pathway. Furthermore, ER stress markers, including GRP94, ATF-6alpha, CHOP, and eIF2alpha, were strongly downregulated by Abeta, independent of protein degradation, and partially restored by TUDCA. Calpain inhibition prevented caspase-12 activation and reduced levels of ATF-6alpha. Importantly, Abeta-induced GRP94 downregulation was related to protein secretion and partially rescued through inhibition of the secretory pathway by geldanamycin and brefeldin. In conclusion, we showed that the ER is a proximal stress sensor for soluble Abeta-induced toxicity, resulting in caspase-12 activation and cell death in PC12 neuronal cells. Moreover, ER chaperone GRP94 secretion was associated with Abeta-induced apoptotic signaling. These data provide new information linking apoptotic properties of Abeta peptide to distinct subcellular mechanisms of toxicity. Further characterization of this signaling pathway is likely to provide new perspectives for modulation of amyloid-induced apoptosis.","Activating Transcription Factor 6/metabolism
