21368091,Comprehensive pathway-based association study of DNA repair gene variants and the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,Cancer research,Qin HD and Shugart YY and Bei JX and Pan QH and Chen L and Feng QS and Chen LZ and Huang W and Liu JJ and Jorgensen TJ and Zeng YX and Jia WH,Missing,"DNA repair plays a central role in protecting against environmental carcinogenesis, and genetic variants of DNA repair genes have been reported to be associated with several human malignancies. To assess whether DNA gene variants were associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) risk, a candidate gene association study was conducted among the Cantonese population within the Guangdong Province, China, the ethnic group with the highest risk for NPC. A 2-stage study design was utilized. In the discovery stage, 676 tagging SNPs covering 88 DNA repair genes were genotyped in a matched case-control study (cases/controls = 755/755). Eleven SNPs with P(trend) < 0.01 were identified. Seven of these SNPs were located within 3 genes, RAD51L1, BRCA2, and TP53BP1. In the validation stage, these 11 SNPs were genotyped in a separate Cantonese population (cases/controls = 1,568/1,297). Two of the SNPs (rs927220 and rs11158728), both in RAD51L1, remained strongly associated with NPC. The SNP rs927220 had a significant P(combined) of 5.55 x 10(-5), with OR = 1.20 (95% CI = 1.10-1.30), Bonferroni corrected P = 0.0381. The other SNP (rs11158728), which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs927220 (r(2) = 0.7), had a significant P(combined) of 2.0 x 10(-4), Bonferroni corrected P = 0.1372. Gene-environment interaction analysis suggested that the exposures of salted fish consumption and cigarette smoking had potential interactions with DNA repair gene variations, but need to be further investigated. Our findings support the notion that DNA repair genes, in particular RAD51L1, play a role in NPC etiology and development.","Case-Control Studies
